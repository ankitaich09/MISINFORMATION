# MISINFORMATION
Data Container for Misinformation Data from LREC 2022


In this repository you're able to download close to 1 Million samples from our dataset. These are divided by disease, and are stored as JSON files. 

All data will be released after the end of the LREC 2022 conference in June. This helps us stay in accordance to citation guidlines, and sharing language resources with you directly.

More data is at the link below owing to Githubs space requirements
