That followed an 8.3 percent drop in March, producing by far the largest two-month decline on record. Total sales for April, which include retail purchases in stores and online as well as money spent at bars and restaurants, were the lowest since 2012, even without accounting for inflation.\n\nMany economists expect spending to rise in May because most states have begun to lift barriers to commerce and movement. But any recovery is likely to be slow and uneven. There is no guarantee that customers will return in numbers previously seen \u2014 and even if Americans feel comfortable going out to shop, they may not have as much money to spend, because millions have lost their jobs.\n\nThe damage caused by the pandemic has also compounded existing problems. At a time when companies like J. Crew and Neiman Marcus needed to be investing money to adjust to changing shopping habits, enormous sums were going to their owners.\n\nBoth companies were facing a host of issues before the virus forced them to close their stores and eventually file for bankruptcy. Those troubles had included adjusting to the rise of e-commerce and a lack of connection with a new generation of shoppers. But they also shared one increasingly common problem for retailers in dire straits: an enormous debt burden \u2014 roughly $1.7 billion for J. Crew and almost $5 billion for Neiman Marcus \u2014 from leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms.",

The Warp Speed project has been described by administration officials as an organizing mechanism for an already fierce race to find a vaccine, one that involves big pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and a handful of government agencies.\n\nMr. Slaoui will serve as the chief adviser on the effort, and Gen.

Here are some of their recommendations.\n\nCheck your community\u2019s health. Dining rooms are reopening in several states that have not met the criteria suggested by the White House for a phased reopening. You should check the latest data on virus cases in your community before deciding.\n\nKnow your personal risk. Anyone who has symptoms of Covid-19 or who has recently come into contact with someone who has had the virus should stay home. And anyone who falls into one of the high-risk categories identified by the C.D.C. should be especially cautious about going out to restaurants \u2014 particularly older people.\n\nLook around once you arrive. Are the tables far apart? Will the chairs permit at least six feet of space between customers? \u201cThe biggest red flag would just be crowding,\u201d said Craig W. Hedberg, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University. \u201cIf people are crowded near the entrance or around the bar, or there\u2019s a lot of interaction going on between staff and customers in proximity, then obviously they\u2019re not operating in a mode that\u2019s designed to prevent transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\nConsider a table outside. The virus spreads readily indoors, as shown by a study of a woman who appears to have transmitted it to nine other people who were eating in the same room of a restaurant in China. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of infection may be lower outdoors. Alfresco dining may be the way to go.",

            "Text": "After weeks of sheltering in place, many Americans are looking for ways to cut loose.\n\nWith bars and restaurants closed to the public in most states, and summer weather approaching, that means that many are heading outdoors to relax and socialise.\n\nAnd for some, that means having a drink - sometimes in spite of the law.\n\nVeteran drinks writer Amanda Schuster says that in her neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York, \"it seems like everyone's over\" prohibitions on public drinking.\n\n\"It's as if people have the attitude that 'no one's going to arrest us for this when they have other things to do,'\" Ms Schuster, who is the editor-in-chief for online magazine Alcohol Professor, told the BBC.\n\nThis laissez-faire approach is something Americans used to have to go abroad to experience.\n\nWhile an 18-year-old can walk into a London pub and order a pint, the national minimum age to purchase alcohol in the US has been 21 since 1984, when Congress passed the Minimum Drinking Age Act, in part over concerns about drink-driving fatalities. In many countries in Europe like Germany, it is perfectly fine to go for a stroll with a beer or bring wine to a picnic. But in the US, carrying open alcohol in public is largely forbidden, except in a handful of municipalities.\n\nA notable exception in the US is New Orleans, Louisiana, a city that proudly boasts its relaxed open container laws, giving it the feel of a European town.\n\n\"We are considered fairly puritanical when compared to other countries in regard to liquor laws,\" Ms Schuster says.\n\nWhen the 21st Amendment repealed national prohibition in 1933, states were given the ultimate power to decide who could manufacture, sell and drink alcohol. That means that most states exercise tight control over who can sell alcohol, when, and where. But as the realities of the coronavirus pandemic transform many aspects of American social life, many states are relaxing their rules.\n\nWithin days of enacting shelter-in-place ordinances and closing non-essential businesses, many states rescinded laws that previously restricted restaurants from selling alcohol to-go.\n\nOthers loosened rules around online liquor sales, or made it easier for customers to buy directly from breweries and wineries.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the sale of alcohol was deemed \"essential\", with the exception of the US state of Pennsylvania, which closed all state-run liquor stores.\n\n\"It's about creating revenue and helping these poor businesses,\" said Ms Schuster.\n\nIn addition to helping bars and restaurants stay afloat, states benefit from keeping their citizens buying booze. Taxes on alcohol serve as a large source of revenue for many states.\n\nAnd as the lockdown drags on, and coronavirus stress continues, the data shows that alcohol sales show no signs of dropping.",

Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden barnstormed the state in early March seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, according to state health department data.\n\nInfections of the novel coronavirus were surfacing \u2014 but not yet confirmed \u2014 more than a week before March 10, the date of Michigan's pivotal presidential primary election and when the state officially confirmed the first case here.\n\nAlthough they tested positive at a later date, at least 365 Michigan residents' symptoms of the virus began before March 10, according to statistics tracked and publicly released by the state Department of Health and Human Services. There can be a lag of up to 14 days before someone who is infected begins feeling symptoms, according to health experts.\n\nAccording to the state's data, 13 individuals who later tested positive began feeling symptoms on March 1. Of those, nine were from the southeast Michigan counties of Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Wayne. The numbers are listed by emergency preparedness regions.\n\nAfter someone tests positive, a member of the health department reaches out to the person and asks when the person began feeling ill, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman for the health department. That's how the state tracked the \"onset\" data that's available. Officials couldn't say last week whether any of those individuals with symptoms in early March attended campaign rallies, voted at precincts or joined other large gatherings, Sutfin said.\n\nBut people could have had infections weeks or \"perhaps even a month or two\" before the first known cases occurred, said Stephen Hawes, an epidemiology professor at the University of Washington.\n\nIt is \"highly likely that in most communities, the first cases were present before ascertained by hospitals or health departments,\" Hawes added.\n\nSome epidemiologists already have said Michigan's March 10 presidential primary could have played a role in spreading the virus here. The state ranks above most of its Midwestern neighbors for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and fourth nationally for the number of deaths linked to the virus.\n\nSanders held seven Michigan campaign events in the four days before the primary, with most of them being rallies. Biden held three events on March 9, concluding with a rally at Detroit Renaissance High School attended by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Democratic U.S. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nLast month, in an interview with The Detroit News, Whitmer said it likely would not do much good to \"relitigate every event that occurred in the month or two leading up to our first cases.\"\n\n\"I just acknowledge that we now know that any public gathering is a bad idea,\" said Whitmer, when asked about the role the primary rallies might have played in accelerating the virus spread in Michigan. \n\nShe noted there were other events, besides the rallies, that might have contributed to potential spread, including Big Ten basketball games. And the lack of clear federal guidance at the time meant \"people weren't as well informed as we should have been and taking seriously as we should have been,\" Whitmer said.",

So the agency made official what had become obvious: that the H1N1 virus is spreading quickly in different parts of the world, and its chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, said, \u201cFurther spread is considered inevitable.\u201d The announcement does not mean that the illness, which has been mild in most people, has become any worse. The term pandemic reflects only the geographic spread of a new disease, not its severity. Pandemics typically infect about a third of the world in a year or two, and sometimes strike in successive waves. \u201cGlobally, we have good reason to believe that this pandemic, at least in its early days, will be of moderate severity,\u201d said Dr. Chan, director general of the health agency. So far, 144 people have died from H1N1.\n\nThe decision to raise the pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6, its highest level, is meant to signal to countries to step up their efforts to deal with the disease. It also means that the health organization is asking drug makers to start making vaccine as quickly as possible, with the hope of having some batches ready by September. Efforts to make a vaccine are under way, and stockpiles of antiviral drugs have been opened. But the agency does not recommend closing borders or restricting travel.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise,\u201d said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, the United States government has been in Phase 6 of the pandemic for some time now.\u201d\n\nEven though the disease has been relatively mild in most people so far, governments must not relax, Dr. Chan said. For one thing, she explained, the virus could change at any time and become more severe. In addition, the illness may take a greater toll when it reaches poor countries with higher rates of malnutrition, AIDS and other diseases that can lower people\u2019s resistance to infection. Dr. Chan said rich countries should help poor ones less able to protect themselves. Even in developed countries, the virus can cause severe and sometimes fatal illness in pregnant women, babies and people with underlying problems like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases. Dr. Frieden said people in those risk groups should seek treatment if they have a fever of at least 100.4, and a cough or a sore throat.\n\nA third to half of the severe and fatal cases have occurred in young and middle-aged people who were previously healthy. In contrast, seasonal flu tends to kill the frail elderly.\n\nThe severity of the new virus does not even approach that of the 1918 one, which killed 40 million to 50 million people worldwide. But even the milder flu pandemics took serious death tolls. The one in 1957 killed two million people, and the 1968 pandemic killed about one million. Seasonal flu, by comparison, kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year.\n\nCountries that have not yet had cases must anticipate them and prepare their health systems to treat patients, Dr. Chan said. Countries in the early stages of outbreaks should try to contain the disease, she said. Those further along, like Mexico, should not let their guard down even if the disease seems to be waning, she added.\n\n\u201cThe virus can come back in a second wave,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re over the first wave, start preparing for the future.\u201d",

            "Text": "An 11-year-old girl who attended a Brooklyn school has died after becoming infected with the swine flu virus, classmates and school officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe death, which occurred this week, was the first of a public school student in New York City and one of three new flu deaths that city health officials announced on Thursday.\n\nThe girl, whose name was not released, was in the sixth grade at the Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice, which shares a building with Intermediate School 223 in Borough Park. Students were seen carrying letters home announcing the death and advising parents to keep their children in class. An evening play at the school was canceled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d said Brenda Barranco, 12, who was leaving school early because she felt sick and was coughing. But attendance has been relatively normal at both the Urban Assembly School and I.S. 223 in recent days, according to the Department of Education. Two 13-year-old girls who knew the student who died said that she enjoyed giving hugs and was \u201cvery joyful and playful.\u201d\n\nThey said that when they last saw her about a week ago she was coughing and complaining of stomach pain. She was overweight, the girls said \u0097 a factor that can make people vulnerable to the virus, health experts have said. The other two new deaths were of a child younger than 2, the second death of a child that young, and a person older than 30, the health department said.\n\nCity health officials continued to face questions over their handling of the spread of swine flu, which has killed at least 15 people in the city.\n\nAt a City Council hearing on the issue on Thursday, council members said that the city had been slow to provide information about the illness and that its decisions to close schools seemed arbitrary. Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. of Queens said the public should be told if those who die after contracting the virus have pre-existing illnesses. Health officials have said that virtually all of those who have died had a condition that made them more susceptible to the flu.\n\nBut the officials have not specified those conditions, and the list of high-risk factors is so long \u0097 including heart disease, obesity and being older than 65 \u0097 that as many as one in three New Yorkers may have at least one.\n\n\u201cWhy is the information about the people who have succumbed to this flu being kept secret?\u201d Mr. Vallone asked.\n\nThe new health commissioner, Dr. Thomas A. Farley, defended the city\u2019s reluctance to divulge details about people who have come down with the virus.\n\n\u201cWe have to separate what\u2019s important for people to know and plan versus privacy,\u201d Dr. Farley said. \u201cSpecific medical information about individual patients will not change how an individual or an organization responds.\u201d\n\nCouncil members also expressed concern about the increase in visits to emergency rooms last month. Health officials said the number of visits appeared to be declining, but the department would continue to monitor the data.\n\nDr. Farley said increased federal funding would be crucial as the city prepared for the next flu season and the possibility that a more severe strain of the virus would develop. Flu seasons typically begin in the fall and peak in the winter.",

            "HeadLine": "Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded",
            "Text": "The outbreak of the respiratory virus began in China and was quickly spread around the world by air travelers, who ran high fevers. In the United States, it was first detected in Chicago, and 47 days later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead.\n\nThat scenario, code-named \u201cCrimson Contagion\u201d and imagining an influenza pandemic, was simulated by the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from last January to August.\n\nThe simulation\u2019s sobering results \u2014 contained in a draft report dated October 2019 that has not previously been reported \u2014 drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed.\n\nThe draft report, marked \u201cnot to be disclosed,\u201d laid out in stark detail repeated cases of \u201cconfusion\u201d in the exercise. Federal agencies jockeyed over who was in charge. State officials and hospitals struggled to figure out what kind of equipment was stockpiled or available. Cities and states went their own ways on school closings. Many of the potentially deadly consequences of a failure to address the shortcomings are now playing out in all-too-real fashion across the country. And it was hardly the first warning for the nation\u2019s leaders. Three times over the past four years the U.S. government, across two administrations, had grappled in depth with what a pandemic would look like, identifying likely shortcomings and in some cases recommending specific action.\n\nIn 2016, the Obama administration produced a comprehensive report on the lessons learned by the government from battling Ebola. In January 2017, outgoing Obama administration officials ran an extensive exercise on responding to a pandemic for incoming senior officials of the Trump administration. The full story of the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus is still playing out. Government officials, health professionals, journalists and historians will spend years looking back on the muddled messages and missed opportunities of the past three months, as President Trump moved from dismissing the coronavirus as a few cases that would soon be \u201cunder control\u201d to his revisionist announcement on Monday that he had known all along that a pandemic was on the way. What the scenario makes clear, however, is that his own administration had already modeled a similar pandemic and understood its potential trajectory. The White House defended its record, saying it responded to the 2019 exercise with an executive order to improve the availability and quality of flu vaccines, and that it moved early this year to increase funding for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 program that focuses on global pandemic threats.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that President Trump did not take the threat of COVID-19 seriously is false,\u201d said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.\n\nBut officials have declined to say why the administration was so slow to roll out broad testing or to move faster, as the simulations all indicated it should, to urge social distancing and school closings.\n\nAsked at his news briefing on Thursday about the government\u2019s preparedness, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cNobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nThe work done over the past five years, however, demonstrates that the government had considerable knowledge about the risks of a pandemic and accurately predicted the very types of problems Mr. Trump is now scrambling belatedly to address.\n\nCrimson Contagion, the exercise conducted last year in Washington and 12 states including New York and Illinois, showed that federal agencies under Mr. Trump continued the Obama-era effort to think ahead about a pandemic.\n\nBut the planning and thinking happened many layers down in the bureaucracy. The knowledge and sense of urgency about the peril appear never to have gotten sufficient attention at the highest level of the executive branch or from Congress, leaving the nation with funding shortfalls, equipment shortages and disorganization within and among various branches and levels of government.",

The country verged on an H1N1 panic.\n\nThe new flu virus, first widely reported in Mexico, was infecting the young and healthy, rather than those usually most at risk, the elderly and infirm. Beginning in April 2009, H1N1 flu fanned across the globe. The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic in June.\n\nHand sanitizer was suddenly seen everywhere, and, heeding the often-repeated advice of top U.S. health officials, many people began coughing into their shoulders or elbows rather than covering their mouths with their hands.\n\n\"My patients were so anxious,\" recalled Dr. Danielle Ofri, an internist at Bellevue Hospital in New York. \"They were so agitated. They wanted to know about that swine flu vaccine and when they're going to get it.\n\n\"It was another variation of the flu. Yet for our patients, it seemed so different, so unusual, so scary -- that the emotions took off well out of proportion of the disease.\"\n\nThe toll, while devastating to the families of those who died of H1N1, has not matched early projections of as many as 90,000 flu-related fatalities in the U.S.\n\nH1N1 may have killed as many as 17,000 Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an average year, about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes, according to the CDC.\n\nToday, the visible signs of fear have ebbed. Many vaccination clinics report low turnout and have cut back their hours, according to local news reports. A recent health poll by the Harvard School of Public Health reported that nearly half of those surveyed believed the outbreak was over.\n\nOn Tuesday, a committee of the World Health Organization is scheduled to convene to review the H1N1 situation and possibly begin the process of officially downgrading the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the special adviser on pandemic influenza to the director-general of the WHO, warned the change does not mean H1N1 is no longer a concern.\n\n\"The ending of a pandemic is not an on-and-off phenomenon,\" he said at a press briefing last week. \"We really expected it to be more of a tailing-off phenomenon.\"\n\nAlthough it seems that H1N1 has receded from the public consciousness, Fukuda said, \"It is expected that it will continue to be a significant virus, circulating around the world as we head into the winter or the coming winter in 2010 and 2011.\"\n\nLast week, the WHO recommended that the pandemic H1N1 influenza strain be included in the flu vaccine for the coming fall and winter. A Food and Drug Administration committee took similar steps Monday, which means there will not be a separate H1N1 vaccine this fall.\n\nPaging Dr. Gupta blog: 2009 H1N1 flu strain will be in next season flu vaccine\n\nAlthough some people may think that including H1N1 in the regular seasonal vaccine is a sign that it's a reduced threat, Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said the risks should not be discounted.\n\n\"I don't think there is any reason to minimize what's yet ahead, just because it's in the seasonal flu vaccine.\n\n\"This virus does do damage differently than seasonal flu,\" Osterholm said. \"We're talking about a disease that causes severe disease and deaths in a much younger population where you don't expect to see that.\"\n\nPublic health agencies have been criticized for sounding alarmist about H1N1. But Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine, said not much was known in the spring of 2009 when the virus began sickening and killing people.\n\n\"It is difficult when you're dealing with a potentially extremely dangerous virus,\" said Longini. \"You err on the side of caution. It could've been really bad -- it wasn't. It's much better than not reacting and having a public health disaster.\"\n\nInitially, H1N1 elicited an extraordinary response, described as an emotional epidemiology by Bellevue's Ofri, who is also an associate professor at the New York University School of Medicine and author of \"Medicine in Translation.\"\n\n\"The diseases themselves have their own epidemiology, related to biological environmental factors,\" she said. \"Our perception of illness runs its own independent course from the actual epidemiology of an illness. H1N1 is a perfect example.\"\n\nOne reason that the pandemic struck a chord was that it fit an \"outbreak narrative.\" These types of diseases often originate from developing countries and spread throughout the world.\n\n\"It feels like the world is being overtaken,\" she said. \"Ebola, HIV, SARS were examples of how the pattern of disease development fit this narrative arc and struck our emotion.\"\n\nNowadays, she said, her patients barely mention swine flu.\n\n\"Once this was out of headlines, once the drama of the narrative arc is gone, it's no longer this unknown, evil, dark illness,\" she said. \"Now it's kind of mundane, prosaic and so it doesn't make an interesting movie any longer. So it doesn't concern people anymore.\"\n\nThat's reflected in comments from Christopher Gower, an iReport contributor who lives in Henderson, Kentucky.\n\n\"I think it was overblown, \" he said of H1N1. \"They scared the public pretty bad.\"\n\nGower didn't get the vaccine, because he distrusts drug companies and fears side effects. He considered H1N1 just like a seasonal flu.\n\nWatch Gower's iReport submission.\n\nBut for Egberto Willies, H1N1 posed an imminent danger for his family.\n\nHis wife has lupus, an autoimmune disorder.\n\n\"It was extremely frightening,\" said Willies, who lives in Kingwood, Texas. \"I usually don't get scared but this hit home because you could see the reality of young people dying from getting something that looked like a cold. When it came to my wife, it was affecting people who are immunosuppressed. She was flying blind.\"",

            "Text": "Athena Gurno thought her allergies were acting up when she started coughing in early October. But within days, Ms. Gurno, the 30-year-old mother of a young girl, was in a Seattle hospital, close to death from the H1N1 flu.\n\nDesperate, her doctors tried a still-experimental drug called peramivir. After getting her second dose, Ms. Gurno started to recover, though she is still in intensive care, according to her father, John Spikowski.\n\n\u201cThis saved Athena\u2019s life,\u201d Mr. Spikowski reported on a blog that tracks his daughter\u2019s progress.\n\nPeramivir might also be a life saver for its developer, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, an unprofitable biotechnology company in Birmingham, Ala., that was founded in 1986 but has not yet had a drug reach the market.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal government ordered, on an emergency basis, 10,000 treatment courses of peramivir for its national stockpile. It is paying $22.5 million, or about $2,250 a patient. Shares of BioCryst rose nearly 13 percent, to $11.39.Peramivir is given intravenously, making it usable by hospitalized patients who are too ill to take two approved flu drugs that work against the virus in similar ways \u0097 Tamiflu by Roche, which is typically given as a pill, or Relenza from GlaxoSmithKline, which is inhaled.\n\nLate Thursday, the government announced orders for intravenous versions of Tamiflu and Relenza, which are much cheaper \u0097 a development that could force shares of BioCryst to give up some of their gains on Friday. Peramivir, still being tested in clinical trials, is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for general use. But on Oct. 23, the F.D.A. granted authority for the drug to be used in emergencies for patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu who cannot take or do not benefit from Tamiflu or Relenza.\n\nBefore that, peramivir had been available only through a more cumbersome \u201ccompassionate use\u201d procedure. Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October.\n\nAlthough there are still questions about peramivir\u2019s true effectiveness, some critics say the government moved too slowly to make the drug available, and that even now, access is too restricted. For each patient, doctors must call an 800 number or fill out a form on a Web site run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug is then sent overnight from a central stockpile. \u201cIf you have a critically ill patient, to delay therapy, it\u2019s just incomprehensible to me,\u201d said Dr. Richard Whitley, a professor at the University of Alabama and the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock.\n\nBut Dr. Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the limited supplies made more general distribution impossible. Some doctors said they were satisfied with the existing system.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly accessible,\u201d said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., chief of infectious diseases at Summa Health System in Akron, Ohio, who has treated a pregnant woman with peramivir. Some of the push to make the drug more widely available is coming from investors in BioCryst, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm. John Doerr, the company\u2019s technology guru, was in Washington this week making the case for greater availability of peramivir, according to a person who met with him there.\n\nOther investors \u0097 both supporters of BioCryst stock and those betting the price will fall \u0097 have commented at government meetings on flu preparations, often without revealing their financial interests.\n\nAnecdotes like Ms. Gurno\u2019s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. While some clinical trials showed the drug had an effect in resolving flu symptoms, others did not show statistically significant differences between peramivir and either a placebo or Tamiflu.\n\nThe question for both investors and federal authorities is how much more of the drug BioCryst can sell. So far, the order has been far less than some investors had hoped, though the price of the order announced Thursday was higher than expected.\n\nDr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Many doctors want to provide the treatment for 10 days instead of the recommended 5, she said, so the 10,000 courses the government ordered might actually treat as few as 5,000 patients.",

            "Text": "Just a few months ago, nervous Americans were clamoring for access to vaccines that could protect them against the swine flu. Now there is a glut of vaccine available, and American health officials are renewing their calls for more people to get vaccinated \u0097 just in case the virus resurges in coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization is scrambling to defend itself against baseless charges that it conspired with the pharmaceutical industry to exaggerate the dangers. Our fear is that the public and officials will get blas\u00e9 about the next flu outbreak.\n\nEfforts to rush vaccine into production did not go well. This dry run should lead health officials to push the vaccine makers even harder to adopt new technologies that can turn out vaccine more quickly. International organizations should also streamline procedures for transferring excess vaccine from advanced countries that typically buy up almost all of the supply to poorer nations whose citizens are at risk.\n\nThe swine flu virus first burst into public consciousness about a year ago when it sickened and killed people in Mexico and soon spread elsewhere, leading the W.H.O. to declare that a pandemic was under way. That was not based on the virus\u2019s virulence. Most of the early cases were relatively mild, but there was no way of knowing how bad it might get. It was instead based on the geographic reach of the virus and the fact that it was a new strain, which meant a vast majority of people had no immunity against it. American health officials began a vigorous effort to vaccinate half the population and pushed manufacturers to speed production of a vaccine. The manufacturers couldn\u2019t supply vaccine as fast as needed. Luckily, the outbreaks proved relatively mild, and it turned out that a single dose of vaccine would provide protection for most people, another reason for the current glut. Now the epidemic appears to be waning in most, but not all, areas of the country, further diminishing demand for the vaccine.\n\nDespite the excess vaccine, it would be wrong \u0097 and dangerous \u0097 to fault health authorities for the steps they took to protect their populations. Had the virus been more lethal, the penalty for late delivery and insufficient supplies of vaccine would have been a public health catastrophe. We may not get as lucky next time.",

But he also noted that the results were still preliminary, because the vaccine for the H1N1 flu has been in widespread use for about only two months, since Oct. 5, when the first doses became available to the public. Rare problems or delayed effects might not show up until later, after many more people are vaccinated. The disease centers also posted a report on the vaccine\u2019s safety on its Web site.\n\nThe information comes from two monitoring networks. One is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which receives reports about problems from doctors and other health workers, manufacturers and the public.

            "HeadLine": "What We Learned From H1N1\u2019s First Year",
            "Text": "ONE year ago today, a government worker in Oaxaca, Mexico, became the first person to die of swine flu. At the bedsides of other men and women struggling to stay alive in Mexican critical care units, we clinicians noticed early on that this novel H1N1 flu virus diverged from influenza\u2019s usual pattern of activity in striking ways. It began in the Northern Hemisphere, not in Asia, and in mid-spring, not late fall or winter. It also had a worrying predilection for children and young adults, not the elderly and newborns.\n\nIn the months after those first deaths, the virus ignited a global pandemic. While the epidemic never became as deadly as we initially feared, it was not as mild as some experts now believe. What\u2019s more, it exposed some serious shortcomings in the world\u2019s public health response.\n\nThose who now describe the pandemic as mild base their conclusion primarily on what, at first, seems like a mortality rate in the United States similar to those seen after seasonal influenza. But my colleagues in developing countries would strongly object.\n\nThough we lack reliable death rates from country to country, certainly no one who helped care for the large number of critically ill patients in Mexico could conclude that the flu in the United States was as severe as in developing countries that lacked our resources. Here, the vaccine arrived later than estimated, and only about 80 million Americans received it \u0097 not nearly enough, but a far higher proportion of the population than in many developing countries. In fact, only 26 of 94 poor countries in need of the protective H1N1 vaccine have even received it so far.\n\nWe also cannot count as mild any virus that was so devastating for young adults, along with pregnant women, obese patients and minorities. Worse yet, this virus made itself particularly hard for clinicians to identify. Whereas doctors associate fever and cough with outbreaks of influenza, one-third of patients admitted to hospitals and up to half of infected outpatients in this pandemic had no fever, yet they were infectious.\n\nAnd because it is likely that only patients with fever were tested for the presence of the virus, we greatly underestimated the number of people infected. A telling report from Britain showed that when children were tested in cross sectional surveys after the first wave of infection, one in three had antibodies to the virus, meaning that they had been infected \u0097 this was 10 times more people than estimated from clinical surveillance.\n\nH1N1 posed huge infection-control problems, especially in hospitals. This was because it was found not only on hard surfaces in the environment, which is common to all influenza strains, but in the stool of patients, a feature of avian influenza. Public health groups emphasized the necessity of frequent hand-washing, which surely helped reduce transmission. But those groups also disagreed on other preventatives: for instance, the World Health Organization and Society for Health Care Epidemiologists of America recommended the relatively inexpensive surgical mask, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argued for the N-95 respirator mask.\n\nIn our own country, the virus struck at a time when Americans seemed particularly skeptical about our government and large institutions. The C.D.C. faced an uphill battle to characterize the trajectory of the pandemic, to define its impact, to offer suggestions and to convince a wary public to get vaccinated.\n\nAt times, health officials erred in their recommendations. C.D.C. authorities often said that ill children and adults could go back to school or work 24 hours after their fever disappeared \u0097 even though young children are contagious for up to three weeks and adults for 5 to 7 days.\n\nIt is not an easy task, but our public health authorities need to become clearer about the lexicon of uncertainty \u0097 what they know and don\u2019t know about a pandemic. They also need to be transparent about how they devise their recommendations, which often have to balance between infection control and the daily activities of offices and schools. And we need to identify which social distancing techniques truly help control pandemics \u0097 for example, does the closing of schools and malls minimize the spread of viruses from infected children to adults?\n\nOne year after its appearance, we continue to have many unanswered questions about the virus. Will the novel H1N1 agent become a persistent seasonal virus? Can we produce vaccine more quickly by moving to a cell-based rather than egg-based method? Can we possibly identify the Holy Grail of influenza vaccination, finding a virus target common to all influenza A strains so that we can administer a single vaccination at 10-year intervals?\n\nEven as we work to solve these enigmas, we can try to prepare better for future pandemics. First, we need to approach disease control not as individual nations, but as a global community. In this, Mexico has already set an excellent example. Only 10 days passed between Mexican health authorities\u2019 recognition of a possible new epidemic and their announcement of it, a sharp contrast to the many months in 2003 between the outbreak of SARS in China and its public declaration.\n\nMexico\u2019s transparency was a policy decision made with full recognition of the unfavorable economic consequences from H1N1, now estimated to have cost almost 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Thanks to that decision, we had an edge in fighting this virus. We should find ways to financially reward early reporting of novel infectious agents, while doing a better job of sharing resources and agreeing on common containment strategies.",

            "Text": "WASHINGTON \u0097 President Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, allowing hospitals and local governments to speedily set up alternate sites for treatment and triage procedures if needed to handle any surge of patients, the White House said on Saturday.\n\nThe declaration came as thousands of people lined up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, and as federal officials acknowledged that their ambitious vaccination program has gotten off to a slow start. Only 16 million doses of the vaccine were available now, and about 30 million were expected by the end of the month. Some states have requested 10 times the amount they have been allotted.\n\nFlu activity \u0097 virtually all of it the swine flu \u0097 is now widespread in 46 states, a level that federal officials say equals the peak of a typical winter flu season. Millions of people in the United States have had swine flu, known as H1N1, either in the first wave in the spring or the current wave.\n\nAlthough there has been no exact count, officials said the H1N1 virus has killed more than 1,000 Americans and hospitalized over 20,000. The emergency declaration, which Mr. Obama signed Friday night, has to do only with hospital treatment, not with the vaccine. Government officials emphasized that Mr. Obama\u2019s declaration was largely an administrative move that did not signify any unanticipated worsening of the outbreak of the H1N1 flu nationwide. Nor, they said, did it have anything to do with the reports of vaccine shortages. \u201cThis is not a response to any new developments,\u201d said Reid Cherlin, a White House spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s an important tool in our kit going forward.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s declaration was necessary to empower Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, to issue waivers that allow hospitals in danger of being overwhelmed with swine flu patients to execute disaster operation plans that include transferring patients off-site to satellite facilities or other hospitals. The department first declared a public health emergency in April; Ms. Sebelius renewed it on Tuesday. But the separate presidential declaration was required to waive federal laws put in place to protect patients\u2019 privacy and to ensure that they are not discriminated against based on their source of payment for care, including Medicare, Medicaid and the states\u2019 Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nAs a practical matter, officials said, the waiver could allow a hospital to set up a make-shift satellite facility for swine flu patients in a local armory or other suitably spacious location, or at another hospital, to segregate such cases for treatment. Under federal law, if the patients are sent off site without a waiver, the hospital could be refused reimbursement for care as a sanction. A few hospitals, including some in Texas and Tennessee, have set up triage tents in their parking lots to screen patients with fever or other flu symptoms. A Health and Human Services official said no hospitals had requested a waiver. David Daigle of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said he had not heard of any hospital that has faced a surge of patients so large that it had to set up a triage area or a treatment unit off site. In Chicago on Saturday, health officials began giving free vaccinations at six City College locations, and within hours hundreds of people were turned away because supplies had been exhausted. The city distributed 1,200 vaccines to each site, immunizing more than 7,000 people, said Tim Hadac, spokesman for the Chicago Department of Public Health. All but two of the sites ran out of the vaccine.\n\nAt Truman College on Chicago\u2019s North Side, lines formed at 7 a.m., two hours before the doors opened. Mary Kate Merna, 28, a teacher who is nine months pregnant, arrived too late to get a vaccination. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be a priority being nine months pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hear it\u2019s a national emergency and it scares you.\u201d\n\nIn Fairfax County, Va., officials had planned to have swine flu clinics at 10 different locations on Saturday. But the county did not receive the number of doses it requested, and was forced to offer the vaccinations only at the government building. People began lining up with camping gear the night before to get vaccinations.\n\nMerni Fitzgerald, Fairfax\u2019s public affairs director, said officials were aiming to administer 12,000 doses of the vaccine to those most at risk for serious complications from the H1N1 virus, mainly pregnant women and children 6 to 36 months.\n\nBut that did not stop some other high-risk patients. \u201cI lied and told the doctors I was pregnant,\u201d said Theresa Caffey of Centreville, who has multiple sclerosis and nurses her 11-week-old son, Joshua. \u201cI\u2019m religious. I don\u2019t lie. But it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s for my son. It\u2019s safer for him if I have the antibodies.\u201d\n\nIn a briefing on Friday, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the C.D.C. director, acknowledged problems with the vaccine production. \u201cWe share the frustration of people who have waited on line or called a number or checked a Web site and haven\u2019t been able to find a place to get vaccinated,\u201d he said.",

            "Text": "The World Health Organization has backed itself into a corner on its Pandemic Influenza Phases system and the so-called swine flu. WHO knows it and is working on bureaucratic escape routes. But the real problem is what these alert systems mean for national governments that have detailed pandemic response plans \u2014 particularly the United States.\n\nAfter decades of ignoring the influenza threat, the 2005 emergence of a virulent strain of H5N1 bird flu spawned global concern. The key outcome of that collective worry was a flurry of planning, at all levels of governance, from WHO in Geneva on down to municipal councils in Kansas and Japan. The plans vary, of course, but all start from roughly the same point: An announced pandemic.\n\nThere has been no pandemic announcement for H5N1 because the bird flu virus is extremely virulent, but not apparently contagious between human beings. The WHO Pandemic Influenza Phases system requires evidence of sustained transmission between human beings in two distinct parts of the planet at the same time. That standard has not been met for H5N1 bird flu: So far, so good.\n\nBut based on that same WHO threat scheme, we do now have a full-fledged pandemic of swine flu. The world should be at Pandemic Influenza Phase 6 right now. However, the H1N1 virus has so far proven to be a wimpy virus. Its virulence seems to be well below that of routine seasonal flu, and its so-called RO (or reproductive number) is about 1.4, based on Mexican data. This statistic means each person who acquires the virus infects about 1.4 other people. That\u2019s certainly not a terrifying level of contagion. In contrast, the dreaded 1918 influenza pandemic had an RO of around 3; on average, each infection was tripled. A constant three-fold expansion of an epidemic is a frightening prospect that utterly defies government planning. The concept of epidemic \u201ccontainment\u201d in the face of an RO of 3 is patently ridiculous.\n\nBut if the swine flu RO turns out to be 3, or even 4, do we care? Should the world be put on alert for a highly contagious \u2014 but very low severity \u2014 virus? WHO experts are mulling this problem, trying to figure out how to de-couple their system from geography, and link it more closely to severity and the level of contagion. Nice idea, but not an easy feat, as New York City has discovered. When the first cases of swine flu emerged in mid-April among students at the St. Francis parochial school there was no immediate way to figure out either how virulent or contagious (RO) the virus was. An Australian group has studied the St. Francis school data and concluded the RO in that school was a very scary 3.45 \u2014 perhaps as high as 4.28. The H1N1 virus may be a mild organism, but if each individual case infects more than 4 others, mere statistical odds dictate that many people will suffer and die from the virus. To be blunt, if roughly four times more people can get infected with a mild flu, as compared to seasonal influenza, the virus could be 400 percent less virulent and, theoretically, kill just as many people as a tougher seasonal virus. It\u2019s a crapshoot. But gambling is not a sound basis for policymaking.\n\nThe U.S. pandemic plan links government action to phases of viral activity. While the U.N. system has six threat levels, the Bush administration-designed approach grew out of the Hurricane Katrina experience, and, like our storm forecast system, has five categories. Each category reflects a different level of severity of the organism, based on an estimation of the percentage of people who die as a result of infection \u2014 a case fatality ratio. A Category 1 is theoretically declared for a pandemic organism with a case fatality ratio of less than 0.1 percent: Category 5, requiring urgent government action, is declared if more than 2 percent of those infected are killed by the virus.\n\nThis has proven ludicrous. In the case of bird flu, fatality rates are in the 63 percent ballpark \u2014 far above Category 5 levels. But the wimpy swine flu H1N1 doesn\u2019t even appear to merit a Category 1 designation. The U.S. category system has no metric to discriminate human-to-human transmission rates.",

The aviation industry and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have tried to reassure passengers that air travel is still safe, but so far they have done too little to try to limit the number of such transmissions.\n\nIt is not practical to screen all airline passengers to identify those who harbor infection. A better approach is to educate the public on proper hand-washing and cough etiquette and to give them the hand sanitizer they need to keep clean. Yet on a recent full flight from Boston to Orlando, Fla., I was horrified to see that most of my fellow passengers failed to periodically wash or sanitize their hands.\n\nSeveral of my fellow doctors have likewise observed a lack of hygiene by airplane passengers, and no effort by airline personnel to educate people on the importance of washing their hands. Keeping our hands clean is critical, because aside from being directly coughed or sneezed upon by an infected passenger, we are most likely to catch a virus by touching a hand or an object like a seat, an overhead bin or plastic seatback tray that is contaminated with invisible droplets full of microorganisms (the bugs can survive there for many hours), and then touching our own mouth, nose or eyes. Research has shown that people touch their mouths and noses as many as 200 times a day, and that good hand hygiene can reduce infectious disease transmission in public spaces by half. One recent study found soap and water or a hand rub that is at least 60 percent alcohol is highly effective in reducing influenza A virus on human hands. The lack of communication about the importance of hand cleaning extends to airline Web sites and online travel vendors. Disturbingly, there seem to be no public announcements or printed bulletins in most airports either.\n\nAirlines have said they have contingency plans for responding to infectious outbreaks, but in May, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants told members of a Congressional subcommittee that all flight attendants should be given training in how to handle a person with flu and help in communicating to passengers the importance of keeping clean hands. She also said that flight attendants need to be provided the gloves and facemasks they need to deal with flu-stricken passengers.\n\nAirports and airline personnel should be fully trained in infection control measures, and alcohol-based gel hand sanitizers should be available throughout airports and aboard aircraft.

They harbor more live viruses in their respiratory secretions than adults do and for twice as long. It\u2019s no wonder that schools are a perfect environment for a virus to spread, with 20 to 30 children in a classroom, and hundreds gathered in a cafeteria, gym or auditorium, touching and sneezing on one another. Schools can take several measures to help keep flu from spreading: Hand-washing and coughing or sneezing into the arm or a tissue should be stressed. Hand-sanitizing gel dispensers should be available throughout schools for both staff members and students. Parents should be instructed to monitor their child for flu symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, aches, fatigue, and even vomiting or diarrhea, and if they are present, keep the child home from school for 7 to 10 days.

Argentina, Australia, Chile and New Zealand, where the winter flu season has just begun, are all experiencing major outbreaks.\n\nFortunately, so far, most people infected with the H1N1 virus have had relatively mild symptoms, like those you get with ordinary seasonal flu. Even so, during the spring wave in New York City, hospital emergency departments experienced a flood of patients \u0097 most of them children. Some emergency rooms had several times their normal volume of patients for several weeks. Hospitals in Texas and California reported similar experiences.\n\nWhen this kind of overload happens, all patients, not just those with flu, have to endure delays and reduced quality of care. And this is what we should prevent this fall. The good news is that only a small percentage of patients have been sick enough to require hospital care beyond the emergency department.

There are steps that, if taken now, could lessen the stress on our hospitals this fall. First, we must reduce the number of flu patients who go to emergency departments with mild symptoms. This will involve both educating the public on proper responses to the flu and offering good alternatives to emergency department care.\n\nThe public needs to be informed that most flu patients can be adequately treated at home with fluids, rest and over-the-counter medications (acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever, for example). State and local health departments should urge doctors and clinics to extend their hours temporarily and, if necessary, add employees. In some communities, temporary flu clinics may need to be established and manned by volunteers.\n\nFor their part, hospitals should plan to maximize the number of workers available for their emergency departments and intensive care units. This may mean canceling or postponing vacations, instituting mandatory overtime and reassigning personnel from other departments. They can also minimize the number of people absent because of illness by ensuring that staff members are inoculated as soon as a vaccine against H1N1 is available and monitoring proper use of masks, gowns and gloves.",

But the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were.\n\nThere is, after all, a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe need to balance competing risks\nSo what should we do? Some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed. But those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself.\n\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty often describes these as the \"indirect costs\" of the pandemic. They include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness, financial hardship and damage to education.\n\nSo as restrictions ease, society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks.\n\nWhy you should not expect to be 100% safe\nProf Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the question we should be asking is whether we are \"safe enough\".\n\n\"There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community it's about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling.\"",

And the third, simply, was love.\n\nStan took over his shop in the heart of LA's bustling Westwood Village neighbourhood more than 55 years ago. The unassuming one-storey white-block building sits on the corner of two busy streets. Stan described it as \"the smallest little shop you've ever seen\".\n\nIt was prime real estate: less than two blocks away from the UCLA campus and opposite the Fox Bruin and Fox Village cinemas where glamorous premieres would frequently take place. The exact date it all began is a matter of debate. He believes it was Christmas time 1963, while others in his family think it was 1964. What everyone can agree on is that it quickly made its mark.\n\nWhen Stan first took over it was called The Corner Shoppe - a distributor for pastries, pies, cookies and \"everything else like that\". Everything, that is, apart from doughnuts. Stan came from a long line of Jewish bread bakers. As a child, he would wake up before dawn to fry doughnuts at his father's little Philadelphia bakery, finishing them off with a generous coating of granulated sugar. When people came in to buy a loaf of bread in the morning, they'd pick up one of Stan's doughnuts too.\n\nHe later learned how to make intricate European-inspired pastries.\n\nThe Corner Shoppe had equipment for baking, but when Stan first took over it only sold other people's food.\n\nThen fate stepped in.\n\nOne Sunday morning when the shop was closed, Stan popped in to clean up and, noticing the heavy footfall in the area, saw an opportunity. He called a friend in the bakery business who brought him flour, yeast and everything else he needed.\n\nHe made a piece of dough and fried a batch of doughnuts, then sold them through the shop's window.\n\nIt soon became a routine. Every Sunday, Stan would head into work at about 04:00 to make doughnuts; his wife would drive his three children down a few hours later to sell his creations; and with the money they made, the family would go out for dinner in the evening.",

There are definitely worse places to be locked down than a palace,\" she says. The complex beside the River Thames in south-west London was for many years home to the Tudor king and is rumoured to be haunted by his third wife Jane Seymour. It was later home to Oliver Cromwell and eventually opened to the public by Queen Victoria.\n\nSome 21,000 visitors would normally pass through the doors during Spring Bank Holiday and various events like jousting contests had been planned for this weekend.\n\n\"We were expecting a record-breaking year. It's really gruelling, particularly given the nice weather,\" says Lucy, who is head of the palace. However, she and others on site are trying to make the most of situation.\n\n\"Having the keys to wander around a palace is so special. We've got 1,300 rooms here so I'm using the opportunity to explore rooms I've never been to before.\n\n\"I've [also] taken up jogging - the formal garden has become my personal running track, which is good fun.\" But living in a royal residence is not all fun and games. With a building that is almost 500 years old and only a skeleton staff to keep it in order, there is plenty of work to do.\n\nThe royal ceremonial dress collection, including clothing that belonged to Queen Victoria and Princess Diana, has had to be moved into a freezer to stop pests attacking it. The gardens need to be maintained and weeded. The many rooms are being cleaned and dusted.\n\nLucy says \"it really has been all hands on deck\" and in most cases, a lot of learning on the job.\n\nWhen the chimes of Hampton Court's 16th Century astronomical clock went wrong, specialists had to explain how to fix its Tudor workings by FaceTime.\n\nThe 37-year-old added: \"We initially had to figure out things like how the bins are collected - for the first few weeks we were living in our own filth but now we're sorted.\" While the downtime has given staff the opportunity to do jobs that would have been hard to schedule with visitors present, Lucy says they are all \"so looking forward\" to when the building can open again.\n\n\"It's so odd how quiet it is here and quite sad. While it's wonderful to have this space to myself, it's meant to be bustling and busy.\n\n\"Spaces like this are meant to be enjoyed.\"",

Latin America's two most populous nations, Mexico and Brazil, have seen the highest number of deaths, more than 6,000 and 20,000 respectively.\n\nAnd researchers say both could be significantly under-reporting deaths, with many cases going undiagnosed.\n\nPeru has reported the 12th highest number of cases in the world with more than 100,000 confirmed - which is more than China.\n\nAnd Chile is reporting thousands of new coronavirus cases each day, with more than 500 people dead.\n\nEcuador has seen the most deaths per capita in the region - with around 17 per 100,000 people.

Regular testing of households should soon give a more timely estimate.\n\nWhy is a number above one dangerous?\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.\n\nBut if the number is lower, the disease will eventually peter out, as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Can you compare the UK with Italy?",
            "Text": "The UK has now overtaken Italy to have the highest number of officially recorded coronavirus deaths in Europe.\n\nThe figures - announced by both governments daily - show a total of 29,427 deaths in the UK and 29,315 in Italy.\n\nBut can you make a fair comparison between the two countries?\n\nThere are challenges around doing this at the moment and here are some of the factors to take into account.\n\n1. Population sizes\nFor a start, the UK's population is roughly 66 million, and Italy's is about 60 million.\n\nSo the UK would have to register at least 10% more deaths than Italy for it to have a higher death rate per person.\n\nGiven that Italy is further past the peak of the outbreak, and is now recording significantly fewer deaths per day than the UK, that may well happen. 2. The two countries may not be counting the same way\nThe different ways different countries count deaths also need to be considered.\n\n\"Every country measures deaths in a different way,\" the UK government's chief medical adviser Chris Whitty said at one daily briefing, \"so comparing them to each other is a largely fruitless exercise\".\n\nOn the face of it, Italy and the UK now do it in fairly similar ways - only including confirmed Covid-19 cases in their cumulative daily counts.\n\nBut while it is safe to assume the figures for the numbers of deaths in hospitals are fairly accurate, can the same be said about deaths in care homes or at home? There is no national figure in Italy for deaths in care homes - the numbers are collated on a regional basis and slightly different measures are being used in different parts of the country.\n\nBut, says Eleonora Perobelli, a researcher at the Observatory on Long Term Care in Milan, \"the vast majority of officially confirmed Covid-19 related deaths are registered in hospitals\".\n\nWe do know that the UK figures as of 5 May include more than 4,600 people who died \"in a community setting'\"- in other words outside hospital. We also know that there were relatively few tests carried out in care homes until recently.\n\nBut in Italy, we simply don't know how many of the Italian deaths may have occurred outside hospital.\n\nSo it is difficult in this case to be confident that we really are comparing like with like. 3. Testing\nGiven that the daily figures released by both governments are for people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus, how much testing is going on is clearly important.\n\nTo use an extreme example, if neither country had tested any people at all, nobody would have died after testing positive. On the other hand, if everybody in the country had been tested the deaths figure would have been much higher.\n\nThe UK is currently testing more people per day than Italy, but overall Italy, which has been in lockdown longer, has carried out more than 2.2 million tests as of 5 May while the UK has done over 1.3 million.\n\nFor daily figures that are based on people who have tested positive for the virus, that is a crucial distinction, which makes comparing the figures problematic. 4. What is the age and health of the population?\nThe most useful comparison to make between two countries looks at the total number of deaths from all causes adjusted for age.\n\nWhy would you adjust for age?\n\nWe know that coronavirus affects older people more severely than younger people. Older people are much more likely to have the underlying health conditions that make coronavirus so much more dangerous.\n\nIn the UK for example, in the week to 24 April, we know that coronavirus killed:\n\nFour per 100,000 people under the age of 75\n75 per 100,000 of the 75-84 group\n242 per 100,000 people over 85. Italy has a higher proportion of older people and a smaller proportion of children (who are much less likely to be severely affected) so, if all other factors were equal, you would expect more coronavirus deaths in Italy than the UK.\n\nThe other thing you might want to adjust for would be the overall health of the population, which would be relevant for how many people you would expect to die in a given period.\n\nThis is usually expressed by giving the number of excess deaths. If you were looking for the number of excess deaths in April, for example, it would be the number of people who have died minus the average number of deaths in April over the previous five years.\n\nIt is important to compare with the same period in previous years because we expect more people to die in winter than in summer.\n\nIn Italy, from 20 February when the first coronavirus death was reported until the end of March, there were 90,946 deaths from all causes, compared with the average of 65,592 for the previous five years - that's an excess of 25,354 deaths.\n\nIt would be best to compare that with the six-week period after the first coronavirus death in the UK. The excess deaths figures are published weekly by the ONS.\n\nYou could take the six weeks starting with the week to 6 March, because that is when the first death occurred. If you do that then you find that 89,735 people died from all causes in the UK, compared with an average of 72,812 in the same period of the previous five years, which is an excess of 16,923.\n\nBut you could also start a week later, which is when the first death was registered and so appears in the ONS figures. If you do that you get a figure of almost 30,000 excess deaths.\n\nSo it is probably too early to make this comparison - it currently only appears to be a measure of how fast the virus spread. Given another month of extra data for Italy we might be able to make a meaningful comparison.",

By refraining from imposing a lockdown, critics have argued, the country willingly accepted one of the world\u2019s highest per capita death tolls, with nursing homes especially hard hit.\n\nSwedish health officials have acknowledged the toll the virus has taken. \u201cOur biggest failure has been for our elderly population,\u201d Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the United States, recently told The Washington Post.

That label, Prince William says, could have a negative impact on medical professionals\u2019 mental health.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC\u2019s \u201cOne Show,\u201d the prince, formally known as the Duke of Cambridge, said he was concerned that the rise to hero status could be somewhat damaging to doctors and nurses on the front lines.\n\n\u201cWe made the NHS front-line staff rightly heroes but in doing so we once again give them the burden that we gave our soldiers fighting the war,\u201d he said, referring to the National Health Service. He added that while it was correct to honor their hard work and resilience in the face of disaster, the legendary label might deter them from seeking help for mental health issues they may be experiencing.\n\n\u201cOnce they have this hero tag, they can no longer shake that and ask for support,\u201d he warned. He said it was vital for staff to seek support and look after themselves to avoid a \u201cbroken\u201d NHS system.\n\nIn Britain, residents have taken to their gardens, windows and doorsteps for the last 10 weeks every Thursday to clap and cheer the work of health-care workers. For many, it is an act of respect, a nationwide thank you to those risking their lives to save others \u2014 although some have refused to take part in the clap-for-carers event, calling for better funding and personal protective equipment for health workers instead.\n\nLast month, both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a BBC interview that the stay-at-home instruction was \u201cstressful.\u201d They said there was an \u201cever-increasing need\u201d for people to know how to gain support for their mental health, especially during the lockdown period that was implemented in Britain on March 23. \u201cWe\u2019re not superhuman, any of us,\u201d the prince said.",

Officially, more than 430,000 people in Brazil have contracted the illness so far \u2014 a figure second only to the U.S. total \u2014 although that number is widely thought to be an undercount.\n\nThe spiraling infections point to increasing fears about the virus\u2019s toll in Latin America. Although several countries were early to institute shutdowns, the region\u2019s large informal economy meant that many poorer people continued to shop in outdoor markets or waited in line for government aid.\n\nAlthough the virus was first brought in by the Latin American economic elite, it is low-income people across Latin America \u2014 who often live in dense urban areas, sometimes without clean water \u2014 who are bearing the brunt of the pandemic.\n\nPeru, Chile and Mexico have each reported more than 10,000 new cases in the past five days, according to Bloomberg News, and Colombia has set daily records, too.\n\nIn Brazil, political instability and lax social distancing policies appear to have made things worse. Jair Bolsonaro, the country\u2019s far-right leader, has fought with governors over coronavirus restrictions. So far, two health ministers have left the post, which is currently vacant.",

While the coronavirus has been fatal in about 5 percent of documented cases, experts believe the true fatality rate may be lower than 1 percent but is inflated because people can carry the virus without showing symptoms and not get tested.\n\nThe study proposes that cancer and cancer treatment can suppress the immune system and impact the body\u2019s response to the coronavirus infection, which may account for the increased percentage of deaths researchers observed among cancer patients.\n\nThe survey of patient outcomes began after doctors began chatting about the lack of research guiding decisions about suspending or postponing cancer treatment amid the coronavirus pandemic. Community practices and academic medical centers in the United States, Canada and Spain contributed data on 928 current and former cancer patients diagnosed with covid-19.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors warned that the data could be skewed toward disproportionately representing serious covid-19 cases, because patients with more serious symptoms would seek out medical care, while those with minor infections might not. The cancer patients were also more likely to be older, with a median age of 66, and many had other conditions that have been identified as risk factors that can make covid-19 worse.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors call for further research, but suggest particular caution should be used when deciding how to treat people with cancer diagnoses during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cPatients with cancer appear to be at increased risk of mortality and severe illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of whether they have active cancer, are on anticancer treatment, or both,\u201d the study said.\n\nJeremy Warner, a Vanderbilt University data scientist who co-authored the study, told NBC News that doctors who delayed cancer treatments until covid-19 cases had subsided probably made the right call to prevent their cancer patients from catching the virus.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have covid-19, they want to do anything they can to avoid getting it,\u201d he told NBC.",

India has administered only two tests for every 1,000 people, one of the lowest ratios among the world\u2019s worst-afflicted countries. The testing is increasing, and officials have sounded alarms about an increasing proportion of positive results. The lockdown, which started over two months ago, was one of the most severe anywhere. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered all Indians to stay inside, halting transportation and closing most businesses.\n\nThe conditions were brutally hard on the poorest Indians and those who rely on day labor to survive. And the country\u2019s economy, which had already been ailing, was sustaining deep wounds.\n\nGovernment officials began lifting some restrictions last month, hoping to ease the suffering, and the lockdown may end entirely as soon as Sunday, if Mr. Modi does not decide to extend it.",

            "Text": "If the reopening of offices, restaurants and other public places within countries amid the pandemic has seemed dizzying, the rules on travel between nations are shaping up to be bewildering.\n\nTravel bubbles and airline corridors to allow free movement between certain cities or countries, quarantines and an assortment of other measures add up to a puzzle that even the most intrepid traveler will likely have trouble navigating.\n\nNowhere are the logistical challenges more daunting than in Europe, where optimistic pronouncements about easing restrictions in time for the summer travel season have run into the reality of a patchwork of policies.\n\nFor people living across the continent, the sudden closure of borders came as a shock and fundamentally reordered life for millions who came of age in an era defined by frictionless travel between the 26 countries that are part of the Schengen Zone. \u201cIt would be great if all this could be compressed into something easy to understand, but it is a very complex picture,\u201d said Adalbert Jahnz, a spokesman for home affairs, migration and citizenship at the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union.\n\nEuropean officials are working on an interactive map with all the rules among member states in one place. Even when the platform is up and running, though, it will likely offer a  confounding picture of closed and open borders, with individual member states reaching bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements with neighbors.\n\nFor instance, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece are expected to open borders to each other starting June 1. Greece, desperate to save its tourism industry, also released an expanded list on Friday of 29 countries it will allow travel from starting June 15. (Nope, the United States is not on that list.)\n\nThe Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia have already started implementing a similar arrangement.\n\nFrance, Germany and other western European nations have talked about easing border controls to other EU member states on June 15. That is the day that the European Commission\u2019s guidance calling for the suspension of all non-essential travel into the E.U. will expire.\n\nThe issues confronting bureaucrats regarding travel from outside the bloc is perhaps even more difficult than the issues within the zone.\n\nIf one country allows travel from outside the bloc \u2014 and borders between countries in the E.U. are fully open \u2014 then, in effect, every country has allowed in the travelers.\n\nThe European Commission, which can only offer guidance, is still discussing what posture to take before the June 15 deadline. But officials said that it would be hard to do anything short of either keeping the guidance in place as it stands or completely lifting it.",

The new counting methodology includes fatal diseases accelerated by the coronavirus as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d but not necessarily directly caused by it, the statement said.  \nThe health department said that even with the new numbers, far fewer people have died of coronavirus in Moscow as a proportion of known cases than in other countries, a measure known as the case-fatality rate. Moscow\u2019s case-fatality rate in April was still \u201cundeniably lower\u201d than London\u2019s or New York City\u2019s, it said. But the case-fatality rate is a flawed way to compare cities, researchers say, because it is highly dependent on the level of testing. As more cases are confirmed, the rate shrinks. Russia has tested more aggressively than many other countries, performing 10 million tests nationwide.\n\nUntil now, Russia had adopted a different standard of what counts as a coronavirus death than the United States and Western Europe. Even if a patient tested positive for Covid-19, some death reports gave a narrower cause of death, researchers say. Russia carries out autopsies on all those who die and has argued that this gives a more precise accounting the cause of death.\n\nMoscow\u2019s number of deaths from all causes saw a significant spike in April. But it was not anywhere near the levels seen in the hardest-hit cities in Europe, Latin America and the United States. With 387,623 infections as of Friday, Russia has the third-largest known outbreak after the United States and Brazil.\n\nThe April data gives an incomplete picture, as the outbreak hit Moscow hard only in the middle of the month. Mortality figures for May will provide a clearer view of Russia\u2019s status. Moscow health officials warned this week that deaths could rise sharply this month.\n\nWhen The New York Times and other news organizations reported earlier this month that Moscow\u2019s coronavirus death toll for April appeared significantly higher than reported, the authorities demanded that the stories be retracted while legislators called for a criminal investigation into fake news and the expulsion of foreign journalists.",

            "Text": "The flu virus is constantly mutating, and has a rare ability to combine with similar viruses to pose a new threat. This is how swine flu first came about in 2009. Flu viruses mutate over time causing small changes to proteins on their surface called antigens. If the immune system has met a particular strain of the virus before, it is likely to have some immunity; but if the antigens are new to the immune system, it will be weakened. The influenza A virus can mutate in two different ways; antigenic drift, in which existing antigens are subtly altered, and antigenic shift, in which two or more strains combine. Antigenic drift causes slight flu mutations year on year, from which humans have partial, but not complete, immunity. By contrast, the new strain of H1N1 appears to have originated via antigenic shift in Mexican pigs. The name \"swine flu\" is a slight misnomer as it is believed pigs acted as a mixing pot for several flu strains, containing genetic material from pigs, birds and humans. Most humans have never been exposed to some of the antigens involved in the new strain of flu, giving it the potential to cause a pandemic. The new virus has made the jump from pigs to humans and has demonstrated it can also pass from human to human. This is why it is demanding so much attention from health authorities. The virus passes from human to human like other types of flu, either through coughing, sneezing, or by touching infected surfaces, although little is known about how the virus acts on humans.",

            "Text": "The H1N1 virus has now become the dominant influenza virus around the globe, with high levels and an increase of activity in many regions, the World Health Organization said Thursday.\n\nIn a weekly update, the WHO's point person on the H1N1 virus, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu.\n\nLike seasonal flu, H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer, and a majority of infected people get better on their own, Fukuda said. H1N1 also is as transmissible and infectious as seasonal flu, he said.\n\nBut unusually for influenza, Fukuda said, H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65.\n\nSeven months into the pandemic, the virus commonly known as swine flu remains at high levels and continues to increase in North America, Fukuda said. Mexico, for example, has seen more cases from September to November than they saw in the preceding months from April, when the virus emerged, he said.\n\nThe virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia, Fukuda said.\n\nHealth officials this week reported an outbreak of cases in Ukraine, which now has more than 250,000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care, the WHO said.\n\nActivity is picking up in East Asia, Fukuda said. Mongolia reported \"a number\" of cases over the past week, he said. \"East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation,\" Fukuda said. \"But even in that part of the world, the pandemic virus is becoming dominant.\"\n\nMore cases are being reported from a number of Caribbean countries such as Cuba and Haiti, he said.\n\nIn Central America and the Southern Hemisphere, however, activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season, Fukuda said.\n\n\"There are several regions in the world -- North America, Europe, Northern and Central Asia -- where we are clearly seeing pandemic influenza activity increase,\" he said, but \"there is no one single place in the world where we are focused on.\" Disease activity has been difficult to predict, Fukuda said.\n\n\"We really are not going to know what the future is going to bring, and so the main focus of our effort here is ... what steps are needed to make sure countries are as prepared as possible to deal with disease levels,\" he said.\n\nH1N1 poses different challenges in different countries, but it does seem to be affecting indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups, he said.\n\nIn Australia, for example, \"aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic,\" Fukuda said.\n\nThe WHO still doesn't know whether the effect on indigenous groups is because of the pandemic itself or because of underlying factors.\n\nBecause most people infected with swine flu tend to recover on their own and don't suffer major problems afterwards, some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it's not serious. But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set.\n\n\"At WHO, we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications [that lead to death],\" he said. \"We do see that the serious complications are concentrated in the younger age groups rather than the older age groups.\"\n\nWhile the complications are most often seen in people who have chronic, underlying health conditions and in pregnant women, they also can develop in people \"who are currently healthy and young.\"\n\nBut contrary to some reports, Fukuda said, the WHO has not seen big mutations in the virus since it first emerged. He said viruses being isolated now are \"generally similar\" to those isolated over the past several months, indicating they haven't changed much.\n\nThe WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said. There have been sporadic instances of resistance to oseltamivir -- the generic name for Tamiflu, one of the main drugs used against influenza -- but such cases are still \"isolated and infrequent,\" he said.\n\n\"Antivirals are quite useful against these infections,\" he said.\n\nFukuda praised as \"innovative\" the decision by Norway to distribute antiviral medication over the counter for a limited period of time. The move can help take stress off the primary health system and allow patients to get the medicine more quickly, he said.\n\nOther useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.\n\n\"These vaccines now have been used in a significant number of countries ... and based on this experience, in which millions of people have now received vaccine, we in fact see that these vaccines are very safe,\" he said.\n\nThe only side effects are swelling and pain at the injection site, but \"these are occurring at rates that are expected and usually seen with seasonal influenza vaccine,\" Fukuda said.\n\n\"WHO, along with other public health authorities, believes that these vaccines are very useful against pandemic infections and [we] do support their use,\" he said.",

In a March tweet, Trump said that \"their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster.\"\nIn 2009, then-businessman Trump said, \"I think it's fine. It's the flu. It's the flu,\" noting that mankind has had epidemics and flus before.\n\"It's going to be handled. It's going to come. It's going to be bad. And maybe it will be worse than the normal flu seasons.

Have you had the flu many times, Neil (Cavuto)? Probably. You know, we all have.\"\nThe remarks are similar to ones he would make as president 11 years later about the coronavirus, in which he downplayed the virus by comparing its death toll to the flu. Weeks later, Trump pivoted to say that the coronavirus was \"not the flu. It's vicious.\"\nA CNN KFile review of transcripts of Trump's media appearances on television and radio, at public events and in his Twitter feed found no other examples of Trump mentioning the H1N1 outbreak until this year. The President was a frequent critic of then-President Barack Obama throughout most of his tenure in office. Amid the handling of his administration's own public health crisis, Trump has tried to deflect blame by pointing to the Obama administration's H1N1 flu response, particularly attacking former Vice President Joe Biden, his presumptive 2020 presidential election opponent.\nIn March of this year, Trump tweeted that \"their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!\"\nLast month Trump tweeted, \"Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence!\"\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 12,469 people in the US died from the H1N1 flu in 2009 and 2010. A CNN poll from late 2009 showed that 57% of respondents approved of Obama's handling of the swine flu, despite vaccine shortages at the time. \u200b\nThe first H1N1 flu death in the US occurred on the same day as Trump's Fox News interview, though it's unclear if that was announced before the interview took place.\nIn the 2009 Fox News interview, Trump also cautioned against overreacting to the virus and said\u200b that \"vaccines can be very dangerous.\"\nIn the interview, host Neil Cavuto referenced the government's mishandling of the 1976 swine flu outbreak, which led to unnecessary vaccinations that killed at least 25 people and caused 500 people to suffer from Guillain-Barre syndrome, which damages nerves and can lead to paralysis, before the vaccinations were suspended.\n\"We pushed vaccines on people that killed a lot of people, paralyzed a lot of people. Do we risk doing the same now?\" asked Cavuto.\n\"I think you do. And I think the vaccines can be very dangerous. And obviously, you know, a lot of people are talking about vaccines for children with respect to autism. And every report comes out like, you know, that doesn't happen. But a lot of people feel that the vaccines are what causes autism in children,\" Trump said. There is no evidence that vaccines cause or are linked to autism, according to the CDC.\nHe added, \"This is the flu. And it's a bad flu season perhaps, although it hasn't even started yet. But it's a bad flu season, perhaps. And maybe it won't be. But I do think we shouldn't be over-reacting.\"\nCavuto then asked Trump, \"So if one of your kids should say, I'm feeling a little sick, I need to take a day off from school, you're not going to let them?\"\nTrump responded, \"Well, I'd let them, absolutely. If they're not feeling well, I would certainly let them. But I don't think I'd inject them with all sorts of vaccines that really nobody right now knows if it works with respect to what they're, what they're looking at right now, Neil.\"\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, \"President Trump's highest priority has been the health and safety of the American people, which is why he has encouraged the use of vaccines and told parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated. Any new vaccine must be thoroughly tested to ensure it is effective, and that is why Operation Warp Speed is being led by expert scientists focused on safety and saving lives.\"\nOn Friday, Trump predicted that a vaccine for the coronavirus could be developed by the end of the year, but experts warn that is unlikely.",

With seasonal flu and H1N1, this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place \"enormous stress\" on intensive care units nationwide, which normally operate near capacity, the report says.\n\nAn H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September, at the beginning of the school year, and infections may peak in mid-October, according to the report. However, the H1N1 vaccine isn't expected to be available until mid-October, and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity, the report says.

Arrangements are being made to isolate anyone who's sick in their rooms by moving out their roommates and dropping off meals, Cohen said.\n\nNone of the school's cases of swine flu -- also called H1N1 -- has proven fatal or resulted in a hospitalization, he said, and none of the reported cases has been confirmed.

Vaccine developers hope to get the doses out by mid-October, before the flu season really shifts into high gear.\n\nAlthough both boys dislike needles, they are willing to make the sacrifice. \"One boy that I knew at our school died from a type of the flu,\" said Andrew, frowning. \"So I wanted to prevent that as much as I could.\"\n\nThe boys, who live in the suburbs between Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, got their first inoculations at the vaccine satellite office in Frederick, Maryland. The trial is being conducted by the University of Maryland School of Medicine, one of 11 institutions across the country holding pediatric trials. Researchers will test the boys' blood, have them keep journals and make sure they have no severe reactions after each vaccine.\n\nThe pediatric studies are divided into two groups within the United States. Half the sites will be comparing reactions between the H1N1 shot and the seasonal influenza vaccines on kids; the others will be looking at the effectiveness of a two-dose vaccine. The Steins are enrolled in the dosage trial.",

            "Text": "He sought to shock the country into dealing with AIDS as a public-health emergency and foresaw that it could kill millions regardless of sexual orientation. Larry Kramer, the noted writer whose raucous, antagonistic campaign for an all-out response to the AIDS crisis helped shift national health policy in the 1980s and \u201990s, died on Wednesday morning in Manhattan. He was 84.\n\nHis husband, David Webster, said the cause was pneumonia. Mr. Kramer had weathered illness for much of his adult life. Among other things he had been infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, contracted liver disease and underwent a successful liver transplant.\n\nAn author, essayist and playwright \u2014 notably hailed for his autobiographical 1985 play, \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d \u2014 Mr. Kramer had feet in both the world of letters and the public sphere. In 1981 he was a founder of the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, the first service organization for H.I.V.-positive people, though his fellow directors effectively kicked him out a year later for his aggressive approach. (He returned the compliment by calling them \u201ca sad organization of sissies.\u201d) He was then a founder of a more militant group, Act Up (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), whose street actions demanding a speedup in AIDS drugs research and an end to discrimination against gay men and lesbians severely disrupted the operations of government offices, Wall Street and the Roman Catholic hierarchy. \u201cOne of America\u2019s most valuable troublemakers,\u201d Susan Sontag called him.\n\nEven some of the officials Mr. Kramer accused of \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d recognized that his outbursts were part of a strategy to shock the country into dealing with AIDS as a public-health emergency. In the early 1980s, he was among the first activists to foresee that what had at first caused alarm as a rare form of cancer among gay men would spread worldwide, like any other sexually transmitted disease, and kill millions of people without regard to sexual orientation. Under the circumstances, he said, \u201cIf you write a calm letter and fax it to nobody, it sinks like a brick in the Hudson.\u201d The infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was one who got the message \u2014 after Mr. Kramer wrote an open letter published in The San Francisco Examiner in 1988 calling him a killer and \u201can incompetent idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you got past the rhetoric,\u201d Dr. Fauci said in an interview for this obituary, \u201cyou found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold.\u201d\n\n[Read about Dr. Fauci\u2019s relationship with Larry Kramer.]\n\nMr. Kramer, he said, had helped him to see how the federal bureaucracy was indeed slowing the search for effective treatments. He credited Mr. Kramer with playing an \u201cessential\u201d role in the development of elaborate drug regimens that could prolong the lives of those infected with H.I.V., and in prompting the Food and Drug Administration to streamline its assessment and approval of certain new drugs.\n\nIn recent years Mr. Kramer developed a grudging friendship with Dr. Fauci, particularly after Mr. Kramer developed liver disease and underwent the transplant in 2001; Dr. Fauci helped get him into a lifesaving experimental drug trial afterward.\n\nTheir bond grew stronger this year, when Dr. Fauci became the public face of the White House task force on the coronavirus epidemic, opening him to criticism in some quarters.\n\n\u201cWe are friends again,\u201d Mr. Kramer said in an email to the reporter John Leland of The New York Times for an article published at the end of March. \u201cI\u2019m feeling sorry for how he\u2019s being treated. I emailed him this, but his one line answer was, \u2018Hunker down.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt his death Mr. Kramer was at work on a play centered on the epidemic. \u201cIt\u2019s about gay people having to live through three plagues,\u201d he told Mr. Leland \u2014 H.I.V./AIDS, Covid-19 and the decline of the human body, an inevitability brought home to him last year when he fell and broke a leg in his apartment, then lay on the floor for hours waiting for a home attendant to arrive.",

            "Text": "And rural America is not ready. While there are still about a million people living with H.I.V. in the United States, in some of America\u2019s largest cities, the news about H.I.V. and AIDS is surprisingly positive.\n\n\u201cNew H.I.V. Diagnoses Fall to Historic Lows,\u201d the New York City Department of Health announced on Nov. 22, reporting that the largest city in the United States had fewer new diagnoses of H.I.V. in 2018 than during any year since statistics were first kept in 2001. This was just a few weeks after Philadelphia\u2019s Department of Public Health reported a 14 percent drop in the number of newly diagnosed H.I.V. infections overall, and a drop of more than one-third among black men who have sex with men \u2014 an especially vulnerable population.\n\nSan Francisco and Chicago have also seen their rates of new H.I.V. infections falling.\n\nBut while robust municipal health campaigns are creating downward H.I.V. trends in some of America\u2019s largest cities, in much of rural America, an opposite trend is emerging. There have of course always been cases of H.I.V. in sparsely populated parts of the country, but in these places far from cities, the conditions that lead to H.I.V. transmission are now intensifying \u2014 and rural America is not ready for the coming crisis. Indeed, in Appalachian West Virginia, the crisis has already arrived. A cluster of 80 new H.I.V. infections has been diagnosed since early last year in Cabell County. As A. Toni Young, an AIDS activist, puts it, the \u201cepidemic of opioid addiction \u2014 fueled by drug companies\u2019 promotion of pain medications beginning in the 1990s \u2014 is a crisis for rural regions in part because these regions are completely unprepared to deal with the magnitude of the problem.\u201d Ms. Young founded what is now called the Community Education Group in Washington, D.C., in 1993, originally to address H.I.V. and AIDS in women. An African-American lesbian, she has spent most of the past 30 years working to help members of the black, gay and urban communities it affects. But since her recent move to West Virginia, near the Appalachian coal fields, she\u2019s seen the crisis take a different shape. Unlike large urban areas that have dealt with similar health and substance crises in the past, and that have networks of service providers and consumers in place, small rural health jurisdictions often lack the infrastructure to confront the crisis and have little history of dealing with comparable health issues, she explained.\n\nAnd it\u2019s quite a crisis. Between 2006 and 2016, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported, nearly 21 million opioid pills were sent to a single West Virginia town of 2,900 people. For years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia has had the highest rate of drug overdose deaths of any state in the country. By 2017 in Jefferson County, one in four people had a controlled-substance prescription. And when prescription highs can\u2019t be sustained, people often turn to using \u2014 and sharing \u2014 needles to inject heroin and then fentanyl, leading to hepatitis C and H.I.V. This avoidable crisis has been exacerbated by unemployment, declining coal mining production and economic pressures on regional press to act as effectively as a watchdog.\n\nAt the same time, health care is relatively inaccessible. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to get to the nearest town to see a doctor,\u201d Dr. Judith Feinberg, professor of medicine at West Virginia University, explained, pointing to a lack of transportation and stigma as the biggest barriers to testing and care. People living with H.I.V. are stigmatized everywhere, but those who live in large cities can get tested while feeling relatively anonymous in a clinic in ways rural dwellers cannot. What\u2019s happening in West Virginia shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. After a hepatitis C and H.I.V. outbreak in Scott County, Ind., in 2014 and 2015 that was fueled by deindustrialization and opioids, the C.D.C. released a list of 220 counties similarly vulnerable to such outbreaks among people who use intravenous drugs. The densest concentration of those counties is along the Appalachian Trail, with 28 of them in West Virginia \u2014 more than half of the state\u2019s 55 counties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way that doesn\u2019t wind up as an H.I.V. outbreak in the state,\u201d Ms. Young says. Yet unlike in places like New York \u2014 with its comprehensive sex education; efforts at queer- and trans-specific public health; embrace of public syringe exchanges; and what its health commissioner, Oxiris Barbot, describes as a \u201csex positive approach\u201d \u2014 when it comes to confronting its H.I.V. epidemic, rural America is ill-prepared at best and antagonistic at worst.\n\nFor instance, despite research showing that syringe programs are effective at limiting transmission of H.I.V. and encouraging people to enter drug treatment, two cities in West Virginia \u2014 Clarksburg and Charleston \u2014 have recently moved to close or limit their needle-exchange programs. Negative press, business worries and conservative approaches are among the reasons the programs have been reduced when they urgently need to be expanded (along with statewide testing and education about preventive H.I.V. medication).\n\nI have seen such tragic, avoidable public health policies unfold in a suburban setting in my own research in America\u2019s heartland. Since 2014, I have been reporting and researching in St. Charles County, Mo., a \u201cwhite flight\u201d suburb to the west of St. Louis, where the local prosecuting attorney charged Michael L. Johnson with multiple felonies for transmitting H.I.V. (Mr. Johnson\u2019s conviction was overturned on appeal in 2016.). Even though criminalizing H.I.V. is not effective in decreasing rates of H.I.V., one of the reasons the county wanted to prosecute and imprison Mr. Johnson was likely to prevent him from transmitting the virus to others in order to protect the public health. Yet in 2017, St. Charles County closed its only clinic for sexually transmitted infections, which provided nearly 1,000 exams a year. With fewer people getting tested \u2014 and with fewer people living with the virus taking medication that can prevent transmission to others \u2014 more people in this area could become H.I.V. positive.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that people who are black, queer, transgender, homeless, incarcerated or poor, or who use injection drugs, are disproportionately affected by H.I.V. and AIDS, the misguided impression that members of these groups are the only ones affected has unfortunately contributed to the media\u2019s choice to deprioritize coverage of H.I.V. and AIDS in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the rural, heterosexual white Americans who have been the subject of countless national profiles because they\u2019re imagined \u2014  incorrectly \u2014 to represent all of President Trump\u2019s supporters, are more at risk all the time. But while we\u2019re bombarded by analyses of many aspects of their plight, we don\u2019t hear about this crisis facing them.\n\nIt\u2019s time for that to change, and for policymakers to address the root conditions that allow H.I.V. and AIDS to flourish in rural communities. In West Virginia this includes increasing access to health care, supporting all workers hurt by deindustrialization and undoing the stigma tied to sex and drug use.\n\nThese changes will, of course, provide much-needed help for the people in urban cities where H.I.V. rates are dropping as well. But the new major terrain of the crisis right now is in rural America, and it can\u2019t be ignored any longer.",

Azar II, the health and human services secretary, essentially explained how the government plans to distribute the drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that were promised in May by the drugmaker Gilead Sciences.\n\nPrEP describes a strategy of preventing infection with H.I.V. by taking a single pill a day, either Truvada or Descovy. Both are made by Gilead. The strategy is 99 percent effective at preventing infection, studies have shown, and is a mainstay of the administration\u2019s campaign to end the H.I.V. epidemic.\n\nSome American cities with high H.I.V. rates, such as San Francisco, already have programs that pay the costs of PrEP for the uninsured. Gilead itself offers the drug at no cost to those who cannot afford it, or picks up insurance co-pays for patients who qualify. But the new program \u2014 called Ready, Set, PrEP \u2014 marks the first time the federal government is supplying PrEP to patients not enrolled in Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration or any other federal health program.\n\nUnder the new program, any patient who lacks health insurance, has had a recent negative H.I.V. test and has a prescription for PrEP \u2014 presumably obtained from a doctor \u2014 can call 855-447-8410 or sign onto a new government website, getyourprep.com, to apply for free H.I.V.-prevention drugs. They can also apply in person, Mr. Azar said, through a participating health care provider, such as a community clinic.\n\nUntil March 30, the government will pay Gilead $200 per bottle \u2014 each bottle of Truvada contains 30 pills \u2014 to cover the cost of moving donated drugs from factories through the supply chain to patients, Mr. Azar said. After that, he said, the Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS chains will donate dispensing services and offer counseling to patients, and the government will seek cheaper ways to get the drugs from Gilead to those chains.",

            "Text": "In taking the time to get to know his subjects, Andy Cohen paints a compelling portrait of those suffering from a public health crisis. An estimated 300,000 residents of Henan Province in China contracted H.I.V. during a local epidemic that dates to the 1990s, according to the documentary \u201cXimei.\u201d At that time, officials encouraged peasants to sell their blood for pittances. The virus spread through contaminated equipment and transfusions. Years later, AIDS patients in Henan are still shunned \u2014 scorned by their families, denied care by certain hospitals and made to fill out complicated forms for reimbursement (even though many are illiterate). Liu Ximei, the activist at the movie\u2019s center, contracted the virus as a girl. Now in her 30s, she ran a halfway house for fellow patients. She serves as a thorn in the side of government officials who would rather wish this public-health crisis away. In the tensest development she comes under the supervision of a local surveillance official, who we\u2019re told at one point is alarmed to learn that she has absconded to Geneva to talk with the Joint United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS.\n\nXimei\u2019s stealthy excursion to Switzerland is the sort of development a filmmaker usually captures only by hanging around. It is clear that Andy Cohen, who made the movie over seven years (Gaylen Ross is credited as co-director, and Ai Weiwei as executive producer), took the time to get to know his subject. We learn about the time when Ximei lived in a hospital with mainly dogs and cats to keep her company, and how she reunited with her biological mother. This isn\u2019t a groundbreaking documentary, but it does pay its subjects the ultimate courtesy, treating them as officials have not: as fully rounded human beings.",

            "Text": "In the South, black houses of worship are reducing the social suffering of H.I.V. with an approach that recalls Dr. King\u2019s teachings. ATLANTA \u2014 The second Wednesday of the month is always crowded in the parking lot of Bible Way Ministries. That\u2019s the day the church offers its community food bank \u2014 and as of this year, it\u2019s also the day when an AIDS Healthcare Foundation mobile testing unit rolls up to provide H.I.V. testing to anyone who wants it.\n\nBible Way had already been offering H.I.V. testing some Sundays and at special events for five years, said the senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. Monte Norwood, his voice barely audible over gospel music blaring from the black testing van. The testers have made one new diagnosis here, but even if they hadn\u2019t, the van\u2019s presence would have value, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol that we\u2019re interested in addressing this issue, people knowing their status and being connected to care and treatment if they need to,\u201d he said, to \u201ckind of remove the stigma.\u201d\n\nThe message appears to be registering: The unit routinely tests more than 30 people per visit. Dr. Norwood himself was tested in front of his congregation. Dr. Norwood, who began ministering to people with H.I.V. in mid-1980s Los Angeles, knows his parishioners are watching him. To anyone who might not be getting the message, he hopes the van makes the church\u2019s message clear: \u201cWe would love everyone to come, no matter what your status, no matter what your orientation.\u201d In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when black communities were hit hard, some black churches responded with ministries for those infected. But as the loudest voices in AIDS activism became those of gay white men, many of those churches retreated into silence, pulled there by a strong cultural current of homophobia. In places where the church was most powerful, people with H.I.V. were forced into the shadows.\n\nWhen Pamela Foster moved to the South in the early 2000s, she immediately noticed a difference in the volume of H.I.V. activism. \u201cThe first thing I realized was the advocacy around H.I.V. was very loud in New York City, and in rural Alabama, it was totally silent. I was like, \u2018What is going on here?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s more stigma in the South, it\u2019s more religious in the South.\u2019\u201d Those questions drove her research at the University of Alabama, where she led a study from 2012 to 2016 that involved 12 black churches in rural Alabama. She and her team developed a faith-based, anti-stigma course built on curriculums used by the Christian Council of Ghana (one of the few such curriculums available) and the N.A.A.C.P.\n\nThe eight-hour course, conducted by a team member and a pastor or the wife of a senior pastor, taught facts about H.I.V. but also discussed the negative effects of stigma and encouraged efforts to fight it. Four congregations took the course, while eight other congregations served as control groups: four took a different course focused only on H.I.V. facts, while four others had brochures on H.I.V. placed in their churches\u2019 lobbies.\n\nCompared with the controls, the congregations that took the anti-stigma course had greatly reduced their negative opinions of H.IV. patients. The study is one of a growing number that suggest that black churches can reduce the H.I.V. epidemic\u2019s effect on black Americans.",

            "Text": "In an unexpected lawsuit, federal officials claim that Gilead Sciences willfully disregarded government patents on medicines necessary to end the AIDS epidemic. After years of prodding by patient advocates, federal officials on Wednesday sued the drug maker Gilead Sciences, charging that it had infringed government patents on the idea of preventing H.I.V. with a daily pill.\n\nThe suit, by the Department of Health and Human Services, came as a pleasant shock to many critics of the company, including Democratic members of Congress who had pressed the administration to act. It is very rare for the government to take on a drug maker over patents. But the medications made by Gilead are necessary to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, which the Trump administration has set as a goal. That cannot be accomplished if the drugs are not made more affordable.\n\nStill, exactly what effect the lawsuit will have in the fight against AIDS remains unclear.\n\nCertainly, it was an unexpected turnabout by Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. In May, he had praised Gilead for donating Truvada to the administration\u2019s campaign to beat the AIDS epidemic. On Wednesday, Mr. Azar struck a much harsher tone. \u201cGilead must respect the U.S. patent system, the groundbreaking work by researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the substantial taxpayer contributions to the development of these drugs,\u201d he said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe lawsuit bluntly accused Gilead of exaggerating its role in developing pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, ignoring work by government scientists and \u201cbaselessly denying\u201d the validity of federal patents. \u201cThe fact that the federal government sued a drug maker over a medication developed in part with taxpayer money is a milestone,\u201d said Zain Rizvi, a researcher in the medicines access program at the advocacy organization Public Citizen.\n\n\u201cWe hope it marks a fundamental shift in how the government will think about the many other medicines developed using public funding that remain unaffordable for millions of Americans,\u201d Mr. Rizvi said.\n\nGilead has responded that the government patents are invalid and denied infringing them.\n\nThe government first applied for patents on prophylaxis techniques in 2006. Gilead recently asked the Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the government patents, arguing that other researchers already had conceived the idea of using drugs to prevent H.I.V. Gilead said it would ask the court to stay the government\u2019s suit until the patent office reaches a decision.\n\nPrEP is a drug regimen: A person at risk of contracting H.I.V. is prescribed one of two drugs to be taken in pill form once daily to prevent the infection. Both of the drugs approved for use in this regimen, Truvada and Descovy, are made by Gilead.\n\nIf taken daily, the drugs cut the risk of H.I.V. infection by more than 99 percent. Public health officials are eager to get more people on PrEP. About one million Americans are at high risk of getting H.I.V. through sex or shared needles and would benefit from PrEP, according to the C.D.C. But just 270,000 Americans are on PrEP, and there are about 40,000 new infections each year.\n\nThe price has been an obstacle, critics say. Truvada, which will come off patent next year, has cost about $20,000 per patient per year in recent years; Descovy currently costs about the same. In other countries, generic versions of Truvada sell for as little as $60 a year.\n\nGilead has said that virtually no patient pays the list price, and that those who cannot afford the drug may qualify for assistance.\n\nThe Justice Department, which filed the suit on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, could seek billions of dollars in royalties, not only on previous sales of Truvada but also on future sales of Descovy.",

            "HeadLine": "An H.I.V. Outbreak Puts Spotlight on Pakistan\u2019s Health Care System",
            "Text": "After the reuse of syringes infected hundreds of children in a small city, health workers say the entire system needs to be revamped. Pakistan\u2019s government suspended a pediatrician accused of reusing syringes and infecting scores of children with H.I.V. after it was discovered that he had been reassigned to a government-run hospital, in a case that raised fury across the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, the provincial government of Sindh, where the outbreak occurred, said it had suspended Dr. Muzaffar Ghanghro, just days after The New York Times published a story about the pediatrician and his role in an H.I.V. outbreak in which nearly 900 of the more than 1,200 cases so far have been children. Dr. Ghanghro was initially the sole focus of blame in the H.I.V. outbreak, in the small city of Ratodero. But government officials now believe that he is not the only cause there, and that the bad practices he is accused of, including reusing syringes and IV needles, are so widespread across Pakistan that the entire health care system needs better regulation. Dr. Ghanghro, in an interview with the Times last week, denied accusations that he reused syringes and needles.\n\nHis clinic was shut after news of the outbreak broke in the spring. But he said that he had recently renewed his license and was practicing in a government hospital with a stream of patients waiting to be seen by him, questioning the government\u2019s ability to regulate the system. Health workers say the government needs to revamp the national medical syllabus to prioritize infection control, currently a minor part of doctor training. And they say hospitals often scrimp on the sterilization process for tools.\n\n\u201cThe only good thing about the outbreak has been that it laid bare the multiple flaws in the system that the government with support of U.N. agencies needs to address,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Mir, a pediatric infectious disease expert working at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. She was one of the first medical workers to help with the outbreak in Ratodero.\n\n\u201cWhat the outbreak in Ratodero says about Pakistan\u2019s health care is that infection control is poor or nonexistent. Pakistan\u2019s health care system is now trying to integrate infection control as a formal part of the system,\u201d Dr. Mir added. She said that Pakistan\u2019s medical practitioners often lack the logistics and supplies necessary to prevent and contain infections. When she was in Ratodero to help, Dr. Fatima said it was a challenge finding clean water to wash her hands with while seeing patients.\n\n\u201cWith the lack of infection control, this outbreak is not unexpected. What is unexpected is that this time, children are the main victims, and there are a lot of them,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the nearly 36,000 residents in Ratodero tested since late April, 1,112  have tested positive for H.I.V., 889 of them young children. With not even a quarter of Ratodero\u2019s population tested, officials worry the real numbers are much higher. The police investigation into Dr. Ghanghro is continuing, and he has been cleared only of the charge that he intentionally spread the virus, the district inspector general in charge of the case said in an interview. Dr. Ghanghro\u2019s court case for medical malpractice is still continuing, said the district inspector general, Irfan Ali Baloch.\n\n\u201cA team of medical experts came and interviewed him,\u201d Mr. Baloch said. \u201cThe medical board determined that he did not intentionally spread H.I.V., but his clinic was in such a condition that the protocols were not being maintained.\u201d\n\nDr. Ghanghro still faces criminal charges, making it unclear why he was recently posted to a government-run hospital near Ratodero.",

            "Text": "Health workers say the reuse of syringes drove the outbreak in the city of Ratodero. RATODERO, Pakistan \u2014 Nearly 900 children in the small Pakistani city of Ratodero were bedridden early this year with raging fevers that resisted treatment. Parents were frantic, with everyone seeming to know a family with a sick child.\n\nIn April, the disease was pinned down, and the diagnosis was devastating: The city was the epicenter of an H.I.V. outbreak that overwhelmingly affected children. Health officials initially blamed the outbreak on a single pediatrician, saying he was reusing syringes.\n\nSince then, about 1,100 citizens have tested positive for the virus, or one in every 200 residents. Almost 900 are younger than 12. Health officials believe the real numbers are probably much higher, as only a fraction of the population has been tested so far. Gulbahar Shaikh, the local journalist who broke the news of the epidemic to residents of his city and the nation in April, watched as his neighbors and relatives rushed to clinics to line up and test for the virus. When officials descended on Ratodero to investigate, they discovered that many of the infected children had gone to the same pediatrician, Muzaffar Ghanghro, who served the city\u2019s poorest families and appeared to be at the center of the outbreak. Mr. Shaikh panicked \u2014 that was his children\u2019s pediatrician. He rushed his family to be tested, and his 2-year-old daughter was confirmed to have the virus, which is the cause of AIDS.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Mr. Shaikh, a 44-year-old television journalist in Ratodero, a city of 200,000 whose residents are some of Pakistan\u2019s poorest, with high illiteracy rates.\n\nMr. Ghanghro was the cheapest option in this city, charging 20 cents a visit for the many parents here who earn less than $60 a month. The pediatrician treated all six of Imtiaz Jalbani\u2019s children, four of whom contracted H.I.V. His two youngest, 14-month-old Rida and 3-year-old Sameena, have died.\n\nMr. Jalbani, a laborer, said he first grew alarmed when he saw Mr. Ghanghro rummage through the trash for a syringe to use on Ali, his 6-year-old son, who is also infected. When Mr. Jalbani protested, he said, Mr. Ghanghro snapped at him and told him he was using an old syringe because Mr. Jalbani was too poor to pay for a new one.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If you don\u2019t want my treatment, go to another doctor.\u2019\u201d Mr. Jalbani said. \u201cMy wife and I had to starve ourselves to pay for the medicine.\u201d Mr. Ghanghro was arrested and charged by the police with negligence, manslaughter and causing unintentional harm. But he has not yet been convicted, and in an interview with The New York Times, he insisted he is innocent and has never reused syringes. The doctor recently renewed his medical certificate and now works as a general practitioner at a government hospital on the outskirts of Ratodero, despite laws that make the reuse of syringes an offense that is not eligible for bail. Health officials now say that Mr. Ghanghro is unlikely to be the sole cause of the outbreak. Visiting health workers saw many cases of doctors reusing syringes and I.V. needles. Barbers take the same razor to the faces of multiple customers, they said, and roadside dentists crack away at patients\u2019 teeth on sidewalks with unsterilized tools. Such unhygienic practices are prevalent across Pakistan and probably the leading cause of the country\u2019s surging rates of H.I.V. infection, according to health officials. But Ratodero is so poor that such practices are likely to be much more common, as residents struggle to make ends meet and scrimp wherever they can.  At first, the government was slow to respond to Ratodero\u2019s outbreak and barely had the resources to test residents and treat the sick. Teams of international health workers from various countries came to the city to help, and the World Health Organization donated hundreds of testing kits. Testing centers were set up in government buildings, while dozens of yellow tents sprouted up across the city to deal with the influx of terrified residents eager to be tested. Still, with not even a quarter of the city\u2019s population yet tested for the virus, officials are dreading that the real number of infected is much higher than the 1,112 confirmed cases so far. The daughter of Mr. Shaikh, the journalist, has become an outcast in the community, he said. Education about the virus is sparse, and many fear contracting it by touch. Relatives won\u2019t hug the girl, and other children will not play with her. At school, the sick children are segregated from the healthy, forced to sit on one side of the classroom.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I, fortunately, we are literate. We hug and love our daughter. But our relatives stopped touching her and are now reluctant to visit us,\u201d said Mr. Shaikh, whose daughter is now responding well to treatment.\n\nFive months on, the panic of the outbreak still hangs over Ratodero. Doctors and paramedics are struggling to cope with the number of H.I.V.-positive patients, while residents are still lining up to be tested. Farzana Bibi was one of those waiting in a long line that snaked hundreds of yards out the door of a government hospital. She had just had her 3-year-old son tested after he had run a fever for three months, and doctors had confirmed that he was H.I.V.-positive. She held his hand as they waited in line to receive medicine for his treatment, a desperate frown on her face.\n\n\u201cIt seems it is God\u2019s affliction on us,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could so many of our children have such a terrible disease?\u201d",

            "Text": "The professional and personal have blurred for young cast members of Matthew Lopez\u2019s play, which offers a communion with victims of the AIDS crisis. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what those years were like,\u201d says a young gay man named Eric, contemplating the worst of the AIDS crisis. \u201cI can understand what it was. But I cannot possibly feel what it was.\u201d\n\nIn an extreme exercise of empathy, his 50-something friend Walter asks Eric to name his closest companions and one by one deals out their hypothetical fates: dead, infected, ostracized. But mostly dead.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Walter says in the first act of Matthew Lopez\u2019s \u201cThe Inheritance,\u201d \u201cis what it was.\u201d \u201cThe Inheritance,\u201d which opens on Broadway next month, is about a lot of things. (With a running time of nearly seven hours over two parts, it\u2019s bound to be.) As an update of the E.M. Forster novel \u201cHowards End,\u201d it is a story about haves and have-nots and the soul of a society in the age of Trump. As a gay update of \u201cHowards End,\u201d it becomes about what is handed down, both literally and symbolically, from one generation of the community to the next.\n\nAnd, Lopez said, a play about generations of gay men \u201ccouldn\u2019t not be about AIDS.\u201d\n\nYet the youngest men in the cast have known only a life of declining H.I.V. infection rates. The crisis of the 1980s and \u201990s, and the public\u2019s blind eye to countless deaths, may have colored their childhoods with fear, but it is all still imagined from a distance. They are all, in a way, just like Eric. \u201cThe Inheritance,\u201d though, offers its characters \u2014 and inevitably its cast, especially the gay men in the company \u2014 a communion with the victims and survivors of the AIDS generation. And, like Eric, they have found themselves newly immersed in the past, thinking about how the epidemic has echoed into the present and questioning their relationship with, and responsibility to, their gay elders.\n\nElders like Edmund White \u2014 the 79-year-old author and brazen pioneer of gay literature \u2014 who was invited to sit in on a rehearsal last month. Preparations were underway for the play\u2019s first preview in New York, after a widely lauded premiere in London that fetched four Olivier Awards (the British equivalent of the Tonys). Holding court over catered sandwiches and bagged chips during a break, White spoke with the cast \u2014 most of whom are new to the production \u2014 about New York City\u2019s gay culture in the days of liberation and the emergence of AIDS. He told bawdy stories about cruising in the standing room section of the Metropolitan Opera, and writing \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex\u201d with his former therapist.\n\nHe was also more solemn, recalling how in the early days of the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, which he helped found, he and dozens of others frightened by the emerging AIDS epidemic gathered in Larry Kramer\u2019s apartment, where a doctor told them they should all stop having sex. \u201cWe were like, what?\u201d White said. \u201cFor us, gay liberation was sexual liberation.\u201d While he spoke, the actors in the room listened attentively, reacting with laughs but almost never interrupting. Jordan Barbour, a gay member of the cast, said later, \u201cI\u2019m normally a very vocal person, but that day I was silent.\u201d\n\nThey did ask, though, about what it was like when homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2014 which White said suddenly made gay men a minority group, no longer sufferers of a psychological illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a minority where you don\u2019t grow up with your parents belonging to the same minority,\u201d White explained. \u201cAnd with AIDS, there was such a rupture. There wasn\u2019t much of a culture passing from one generation to another.\u201d This disconnect, of a gay lineage severed, is in many ways at the heart of \u201cThe Inheritance.\u201d Kyle Soller \u2014 he isn\u2019t gay but grew up friendly with older gay men in local theater and says he now feels he has been brought \u201cdeeper within the community that has always been kind to me\u201d \u2014 plays Eric, who wonders \u201cwhat his life would be like if he had not been robbed of a generation of mentors, of poets, of friends and, perhaps, even lovers.\u201d\n\nThere is a personal dimension to the yearning for Lopez himself: 42 years old, he bore witness to the AIDS crisis while not truly being part of it. Unlike Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and Tony Kushner\u2019s \u201cAngels in America,\u201d his play was not written from the front lines of the epidemic. (Nevertheless, it will probably be compared to \u201cAngels\u201d because of its length and subject matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s personal, too, for several members of the cast. Some of them lived through the history \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d imagines. The director, Stephen Daldry, is 59; John Benjamin Hickey, 56, who plays Henry Wilcox (the least subtle tip of the hat to \u201cHowards End\u201d), moved to Manhattan in the early 1980s; and Lois Smith, the only woman in the cast and by far its oldest member at 88, lost dear friends to AIDS. But the youngest actors have the haziest relationship with AIDS, informed by the mass media of their childhood. Barbour, 36, remembered not knowing much about H.I.V. other than that he should be very afraid of it. \u201cThe people who died, it was such an abstract thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could put them in a box. But now I\u2019m reminded that every person who died had a story. They were just people; they could so easily have been us.\u201d One stairwell in the Barrymore Theater, where \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d is now in previews, is decorated with portraits of men lost to AIDS. Carson McCalley, a 23-year-old gay member of the company, said that many of them were actors, adding, \u201cWhat they would give to have the opportunity to be onstage here \u2014 and now I have that opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have sort of a responsibility to do what they could not, to live with joy and passion, and continue the legacy of queer people,\u201d McCalley said. \u201cThey opened doors for us to run. Some in the generation below me are the most outspoken political activists I know. But a lot of that has come from, for good or bad, not having to deal with what the past generation has had to deal with.\u201d\n\nArturo Lu\u00eds Soria, 32, inspired by the play, has also found himself thinking \u201ca lot\u201d about what he owes his predecessors. He quoted a line \u2014 \u201cThe only way to heal heartache is to risk more\u201d \u2014 and said it had made him wonder: \u201cIn which ways am I still holding myself back from loving the way I want to love and being the person I want to be because of this fear from growing up queer?\u201d \u201cAm I being of service to those who passed, who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to be their fullest selves, if I\u2019m not being open?\u201d he continued. \u201cIf I\u2019m not, then I\u2019m doing a disservice.\u201d\n\nOne way of being more open, Soria has found, is by speaking up at rehearsals \u2014 where conversations among generations have been integral to the process. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my Latinoness to it,\u201d he said; Lopez has rewritten his character, who was played by someone of a different ethnicity in London, to reflect his Latin American identity.\n\n\u201cHe wrote a line that said, \u2018Hello maric\u00f3n, you\u2019re gay!\u201d Soria said, adding that he cried out of happiness seeing Spanish slang \u2014 and thus himself \u2014 throughout the script",

            "HeadLine": "California Makes H.I.V.-Prevention Drugs Available Without a Prescription",
            "Text": "The state is the first in the nation to allow pharmacists to dispense PrEP and PEP, drugs that can prevent new H.I.V. infections. California will become the first state in the country to allow pharmacies to dispense H.I.V.-prevention drugs without a doctor\u2019s prescription, a move that supporters say is an important step toward ending the AIDS epidemic in the United States.\n\nUnder a new law, pharmacists who undergo special training will be able to provide 60-day supplies of pre-exposure prophylaxis, commonly called PrEP and sold under the brand name Truvada, as well as doses of post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, meant to be used in an emergency after possible exposure to the virus, without a prescription. Studies have found that the drugs are very effective, but many people at high risk of infection do not take them.\n\n\u201cAll Californians deserve access to PrEP and PEP, two treatments that have transformed our fight against H.I.V. and AIDS,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed the bill into law on Monday, said in a statement. \u201cI applaud the Legislature for taking action to expand access to these treatments and getting us closer to ending H.I.V. and AIDS for good.\u201d Federal data shows that there are about 40,000 new H.I.V. infections nationwide each year, and black and Latino men who have sex with men are at the greatest risk. In his State of the Union address in February, President Trump vowed to stop the spread of H.I.V. by 2030, and wider access to PrEP is a linchpin of that effort. The bill, S.B. 159, was sponsored by State Senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblyman Todd Gloria of San Diego. Mr. Wiener, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who represented Harvey Milk\u2019s old district, declared in 2014 that he was taking Truvada daily. At the time, he said he hoped his announcement would encourage more gay men to consider taking the drug. In a phone interview on Tuesday, he said the new law would make it easier for them to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are big swaths of California where it is hard to get a doctor\u2019s appointment, and sometimes people have to wait months,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving people the option of going into their neighborhood pharmacy and getting a 60-day supply to start on PrEP will make a big difference.\u201d Some medical groups had initially opposed the bill because they were concerned that patients could take Truvada long term without medical supervision. In a compromise, the bill was revised to guarantee a maximum of 60 days of PrEP treatment without a doctor\u2019s prescription. After that, a prescription is needed.\n\nThe law also specifies that patients must show proof that they have tested negative for H.I.V. in the previous seven days before they can be provided with the preventive drugs. According to Morgan Carvajal, a legislative advocate at the California Medical Association, it is crucial to test for H.I.V. before starting PrEP or PEP. If a patient who has H.I.V. takes those drugs, she said, the virus can become resistant to key ingredients that are also found in medicines used to treat the virus. That could limit a patient\u2019s treatment options down the road.\n\nShe added that regular medical checkups for PrEP users are also essential to check renal function every six months \u2014 the drug can have adverse side effects on the liver, kidneys and bones \u2014 and to test for other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nBesides worries about the drug\u2019s side effects, several other factors may contribute to low rates of Truvada use, including its high cost \u2014 about $20,000 a year, if one is paying full price \u2014 and stigma associated with its use. \u201cWe have this highly effective drug and the ability to prevent H.I.V., but getting it to people who need it is more of a challenge,\u201d Jen Kates, director of global health and H.I.V. policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said on Tuesday. \u201cBeing able to go to a pharmacy is much easier than going to a primary doctor. More people who are at risk will be able to get the medication that will prevent them from becoming H.I.V. positive.\u201d\n\nTruvada, made by Gilead Sciences, has been the only H.I.V.-prevention drug on the market since its approval in 2012. But last week, the F.D.A. approved a second H.I.V.-prevention drug, Descovy, also made by Gilead, which may have fewer side effects. That drug has not been tested on everyone, however, and was approved for use only by cisgender men and transgender women.\n\nDr. Aaron S. Lord, an N.Y.U. School of Medicine neurologist and a founder of a campaign that calls on the government to break Gilead\u2019s patent on Truvada to make PrEP more affordable, applauded the new law. \u201cI think what California is doing is exactly the kind of innovative response that we need in order to end the epidemic of H.I.V. infections,\u201d he said. The California law will also require Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, to cover H.I.V.-prevention drugs obtained from pharmacies, and prohibits insurance companies from requiring prior authorization to cover the drugs. It will go into effect in July.",

            "HeadLine": "Someday, an Arm Implant May Prevent H.I.V. Infection for a Year",
            "Text": "In preliminary tests, a matchstick-size rod containing a new drug offered promise as a shield against the virus. But a large clinical trial must still be done. In what could eventually become a milestone for H.I.V. prevention, very preliminary tests of an implant containing a new drug suggest that it may protect against infection for a full year.\n\nThe new implant, by the drug company Merck, was tested in just a dozen subjects for 12 weeks. But experts were quite excited at its potential to revolutionize the long battle against H.I.V.\n\nThe research was described on Tuesday at an international AIDS conference in Mexico City.\n\nNew H.I.V. prevention methods are desperately needed. About 75 million people have contracted the lethal virus since the AIDS epidemic began. Even now, about 1.7 million people are infected each year \u2014 despite decades of promotion of condoms and abstinence, and years of efforts to get people to take a daily pill that prevents infection. \u201cIf \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing if \u2014 if it pans out in a larger trial that it delivers a level of drug that\u2019s protective for a year, that would be a game-changer,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and a leading expert on AIDS. Dr. Robert M. Grant, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the landmark 2010 trial that proved that a daily pill could thwart H.I.V., said he had expected a breakthrough based on the powerful new drug used in the implant. The device \u201cseems ideal in many respects,\u201d he added. \u201cIt can be removed if there are side effects or H.I.V. infection.\u201d Merck\u2019s innovation is to deliver its new antiretroviral drug, islatravir, with a proven technology long used for birth control: a matchstick-sized plastic rod inserted just under the skin of the upper arm that slowly releases tiny doses of the medication.\n\nMany people at risk of H.I.V. infection, particularly women in Africa, are desperate for prevention methods that are easier to use, and easier to conceal, than a bottle of pills.\n\nAccording to Unaids, more than 6,000 young women under age 24 are infected every week, and 80 percent of infected teenagers in Africa are girls. African girls are often victims of rape or pressured into sex with older men in return for food, clothes or cash.\n\nAnother study released Tuesday at the same conference reinforced the extreme vulnerability of young African women.\n\nIn it, 427 women and teenage girls in South Africa and Zimbabwe were given Truvada pills, the form of so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent H.I.V. infection, also called PrEP, used in the United States.\n\nThey were repeatedly reminded to take the pills every day, but after one year, blood tests showed that less than a third were still taking any pills. Only 9 percent of the women and girls took them frequently enough to have protective levels of the drug in their bloodstreams. The study\u2019s authors are still interviewing participants about why they failed to comply. But women in Africa often say they cannot keep H.I.V. drugs at home because they fear being accused by family, neighbors and lovers of being immoral or of having H.I.V. Some fear being threatened or beaten.\n\n(Clinical trials among women in Africa often fail, or produce hard-to-interpret results, because some participants sign up but rarely use the interventions being tested. In interviews afterward, some have admitted to joining only because the trials offer free medical care and modest payments for participating.) The drug used in the new implants is islatravir (pronounced IZ-lah-trah-veer), which until last week was known as EFdA or MK-8591. It is the first in a new class of drugs called nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitors, which block movement of the enzyme responsible for cloning the virus\u2019s DNA so that it can infect new cells. Islatravir has \u201csome remarkable attributes,\u201d said Dr. Roy D. Baynes, Merck\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nIt is 10 times as potent as any previous H.I.V. drug, he said, so tiny amounts are effective, which lowers the risk of side effects. The drug lingers in the body for a relatively long time \u2014 after five days, half of the dose remains \u2014 so it can be given less often that other H.I.V. medications.\n\nUnlike some H.I.V. drugs, islatravir is absorbed into anal and genital tissues, which is where most infections start. And because it attacks a different step in the infection process, the drug appears not to give rise to viral strains with cross-resistance to other H.I.V. drugs.\n\nOther drug companies have recently reported success with other long-acting forms of H.I.V. prevention. For example, injections of cabotegravir or rilpivirine deep into the buttocks have protected study participants for a month. But monthly intramuscular injections are inconvenient and sometimes painful. And implants can be removed. The half-life of injectable cabotegravir, for example, is about 40 days. If a user develops a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d H.I.V. infection in spite of the injection, the lingering drug may drive the virus to mutate into a resistant form.\n\nAlthough scientists are excited about the Merck implant\u2019s possibilities, they warned that it still needs to prove itself.\n\nThe drug has protected rats and monkeys against multiple deliberate attempts to infect them, but human testing thus far has been only for safety: to see whether a handful of people could tolerate the implant for three months without dangerous side effects. The assumption that the implant could protect against H.I.V. for a year was arrived at by estimating how much drug is considered protective and how much the implant can hold. A real-world test will mean giving the implant to thousands of sexually active or drug-using men and women, and tracking how many get infected. Such a trial will be long and expensive, said Mitchell J. Warren, executive director of AVAC, an advocacy group for H.I.V. prevention.\n\nParticipants cannot just be given the implant and told to go out and have sex or inject drugs. Ethically, they must be offered the best prevention methods available, including oral PrEP, condoms, clean syringes and intensive counseling about safe sex or safe drug use.\n\nThat means many subjects must be followed for years to see if the implant works better than other methods. Dr. Baynes, of Merck, declined to discuss how the next trial would be designed or to speculate on how long it would take. The company, he said, would consider testing in both the United States, where most H.I.V. transmission is between gay men, and in Africa, where the virus is passed mostly between men and women.\n\nHe also declined to discuss the eventual cost, other than to say \u201cwe\u2019re committed to responsible pricing.\u201d Price is a deeply contentious issue in PrEP. High hopes for a quick end to the AIDS epidemic raised by Dr. Grant\u2019s 2010 study were dashed after relatively few Americans began taking Truvada \u2014 in part because Gilead, the patent-holder, raised the price to $20,000 a year and sued every generic competitor that tried to enter the market.\n\nOther research groups have begun testing similar subdermal implants for H.I.V. prevention, such as one that contains a new form of tenofovir, the main drug in Truvada.\n\nHigh prices for prevention methods have been a constant disappointment, Dr. Grant said: \u201cThere is always a bright shiny new object with people asking, \u2018Who cares what it costs?\u2019\u201d",

A clinic in the Deep South sees the challenges every day. \u201cI come from the smallest town in Mississippi, in the buckle of the Bible Belt,\u201d said Gerald Gibson, outreach manager at Open Arms Healthcare Center, the only clinic created to serve gay black men in this state.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know anybody like me,\u201d he added. \u201cI come from a culture that says you\u2019re going to hell for being homosexual and AIDS is God\u2019s wrath.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s plan to end America\u2019s epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, within 10 years is not going to succeed easily in places like this.\n\nMedically, AIDS experts agree, the plan he announced in his State of the Union address in February is sound. It has twin goals: First, to get every American who is infected with the virus \u2014 an estimated 1.1 million people \u2014 onto three-drug cocktails that, if taken every day, suppress the virus, keeping patients healthy and reducing almost to zero the odds that they will infect anyone else. The second goal is to get every American who is at risk \u2014 an estimated one million people \u2014 onto pre-exposure prophylaxis (called PrEP), a pill that, if taken daily, protects almost completely against infection.\n\nBut reaching those goals will take a huge amount of money \u2014 far more than the $291 million Mr. Trump requested in his 2020 budget proposal. Moreover, it will require courageous political leadership, not just from the White House, but from every statehouse and city hall in the nation. In the last 15 years, the epidemic has shifted into groups that are hard to test and even harder to keep on daily medication: men who are closeted, drug injectors, the homeless, the rural poor, the mentally ill and those with little income and no health insurance.\n\nBut the group most at risk comprises gay and bisexual black men and transgender women in the Deep South \u2014 Mr. Gibson\u2019s peers and his clientele. More than half of new H.I.V. infections in the country each year now occur in the South, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and often in rural areas.\n\nMany of the newly infected are young black men. Nationally, gay and bisexual black men face a 50 percent lifetime risk of H.I.V. infection. The epidemic cannot be halted, experts say, unless those men can be found, educated about the disease, convinced to protect themselves and their sexual partners, and helped to do so. That often is not easy.\n\n\u201cI had an individual hit me up on Instagram for help \u2014 he\u2019s positive,\u201d said Mr. Gibson, 42, referring to a man infected with H.I.V.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Come to the clinic. If you don\u2019t have transportation, I\u2019ll send a car.\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s not that simple. My family thinks I can be healed religiously.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Gibson paused: \u201cHe\u2019s not on medication because they think they can pray the H.I.V. away.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 percent of all new infections are transmitted by people who don\u2019t know they are infected or who are not on medication, according to the C.D.C.",

            "Text": "San Francisco, America\u2019s model H.I.V.-fighting city, has worked hard to extinguish the last embers of its epidemic. It may not be enough.\n\nIn the 1990s, the city had over 2,000 new infections a year; it has driven that figure down to about 200. \u201cBut we\u2019re plateauing,\u201d said Jeff Sheehy, a former city supervisor and longtime AIDS activist who is H.I.V.-positive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hit a wall. All the gay white boys in the Castro are on PrEP or linked to care, and now we have to reach the hard-to-reach.\u201d Twelve percent of young gay men in the city\u2019s ubiquitous homeless population are infected. Some undocumented immigrants fear deportation and avoid city clinics. Many H.I.V.-infected women in the city have histories of drug use, beatings and rape; they are too traumatized to organize their lives around pill-taking.\n\n\u201cH.I.V. is now a disease of poverty, and you can\u2019t separate it from people\u2019s other issues,\u201d Mr. Sheehy said. \u201cWhen you have schizophrenia and are homeless and use heroin to get to sleep and speed to wake up, H.I.V. is just one of your problems.\u201d\n\nIn response, San Francisco has a corps of \u201cnavigators\u201d who visit homeless encampments and bang on doors in downtown residential hotels to find and physically escort elusive clients to doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies.\n\nThe city employs case managers who fill out complex insurance and Medicaid paperwork to pay for drugs and lab tests. It has opened a \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d clinic exclusively for H.I.V.-positive women who have suffered abuse. For the uninsured, the city has its own taxpayer-supported health insurance plan. In November, the city passed a new tax on major businesses to raise $300 million to house the homeless.\n\nSo what of the rest of the country, where most municipalities have only a fraction of San Francisco\u2019s resources? Both financially and culturally, Jackson is at the opposite end of the H.I.V. care spectrum. And Mississippi officials know it. \u201cPeople want us to jump to being San Francisco right away, and we\u2019re just not there,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, chief of the Mississippi state health department.\n\nAbout a third of gay black men in Jackson are infected, he said. (Although its population is only 170,000, Jackson is the state capital, and the state\u2019s biggest city; it has some gay bars and three H.I.V. clinics.)\n\nOutside Jackson, doctors trained to treat H.I.V. patients are rare. When Dr. Dobbs practiced in Hattiesburg, in the southeastern part of the state, he said, some patients drove almost four hours to see him. Wages in Mississippi are so low that many full-time workers could be on Medicaid. (Even health department receptionists earn just $17,000 a year, Dr. Dobbs said.) But the state legislature rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2016, the health department\u2019s budget was cut by 35 percent; it has a third fewer employees than it once did.\n\nThe state receives some federal aid for H.I.V. treatment under the Ryan White Act, but almost all of it must be spent on medicine. Little is left for the services Dr. Dobbs said he would offer if he had more money: new clinics, PrEP for all takers, and hiring doctors, outbreak-tracking epidemiologists, case managers and counselors. But financial barriers are just one obstacle. The legal and cultural obstacles are bigger.",

Mena, Open Arms\u2019s medical director, asked dozens of gay Jackson men to put condoms on a plastic penis; 90 percent did it wrong, he said.\n\n\u201cThey opened it with their teeth, or they didn\u2019t check the expiration date, or they used a lube that deteriorates latex,\u201d he said. \u201cMany had never used one.\u201d In New York, residents routinely see subway ads for PrEP, some of which show black men with their arms wrapped lovingly around each other.\n\n\u201cThat would definitely not be possible here,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Melvin, Open Arms\u2019s chief operating officer. Dr. Dobbs agreed, reluctantly admitting that his department puts coasters endorsing PrEP in gay bars and public service ads on gay dating sites like Grindr. \u201cBut we don\u2019t put our state brand on it,\u201d he quickly added, fearing a backlash from the legislature.\n\nThere are also psychological barriers.\n\nAn H.I.V. diagnosis \u2014 like a cancer diagnosis \u2014 is inevitably a shock, and many men disappear after a positive test, too shaken to start treatment. Without navigators, finding them again is hard.\n\nAlso, in Mississippi, knowingly infecting someone with H.I.V. can mean 10 years in prison. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even want to get tested because if they know their status, they\u2019re responsible,\u201d Mr. Gibson said.\n\nMoreover, some people do not want to be seen with H.I.V. drugs.\n\n\u201cIn Jackson, a lot of down-low guys have girlfriends,\u201d said Aaron Jones, an Open Arms phlebotomist. Those men avoid the clinic: \u201cThey say, \u2018Is my business going to be spread to the world?\u2019\u201d\n\nJacqueline Wilson, a clinic receptionist, discovered she was infected after catching her ex-husband in bed with a man. \u201cA lot of women are afraid to be on the meds,\u201d she said. \u201cAfraid of what people will think, afraid of what the doctor will say.\u201d\n\nAnd distrust of the public health system is intense.\n\n\u201cPeople have heard of the Tuskegee experiment,\u201d said Regi Stevenson, another receptionist, citing an infamous scandal in which federal health officials let black men stay infected with syphilis for decades. \u201cMy grandfather won\u2019t go to a doctor until he\u2019s almost dead.\u201d Despite the obstacles, 85 percent of Open Arms patients achieve viral suppression, Dr. Mena said, meaning they take their pills so faithfully that the virus cannot be found in their blood.\n\nTo reach that goal, the clinic has to offer many extra services: counselors to remind clients to take their pills, transportation for those who don't own cars, and even a food bank offering weekly food packages, since many patients are so poor they skip meals and then will not take pills that may trigger heartburn.\n\nOpen Arms would like to have an on-site pharmacy too, Dr. Mena said, but has not received a license yet. Mostly, he said, a clinic must offer the right attitude.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t come back to clinics where the nurse makes you feel guilty for sleeping with men, or keeps saying \u2018he\u2019 when it\u2019s \u2018she,\u2019 or threatens to stop your meds if you don\u2019t take them all,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople with H.I.V. are still people.\u201d\n\nLouisiana, next door to this state, goes further: Patients whose blood tests prove they are taking their pills daily get paid.\n\n\u201cFor some folks, that\u2019s controversial, but it works,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Billioux, a Louisiana assistant health secretary. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not sending anyone on luxury vacations. It\u2019s about $25 a month.\u201d\n\nNo matter what tactics a state employs, \u201cmedication has become the simple part of H.I.V.,\u201d Dr. Mena said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is the political will.\u201d",

If approved, it would greatly expand access to the $20,000-a-year drug regimen, since most private health plans are required under the Affordable Care Act to cover the full cost of the preventive services recommended by the panel. \u201cThis is definitely fantastic news and validates everything science has been saying all along,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Lord, a physician at New York University School of Medicine who co-founded the PrEP4All Collaboration, which aims to expand access to PrEP for all Americans. \u201cWe\u2019ve known this is a very effective medication for quite a while, and feel we could be a lot further along in using it to reduce infections. The potential is absolutely tremendous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen taken daily, there\u2019s very good evidence that the chance of acquiring H.I.V. is essentially zero,\u201d Dr. Lord said. Dr. Kenneth Mayer, co-chairman and medical research director at the Fenway Institute in Boston, agreed. \u201cThis is big news. There is no cure for H.I.V., and there is no vaccine, but we have these medications that can have an effect on the epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data are very clear that PrEP works if you take it.\u201d\n\nOver a million people in the United States are living with H.I.V., and 40,000 new people are infected every year. Yet only a minority of those at risk for H.I.V. in the United States currently use PrEP, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that of 1.2 million Americans eligible for the medication, only about 78,360 people used it in 2016. The panel\u2019s new draft recommendation reiterated its call for physicians to screen all patients aged 15 to 65 for H.I.V. but, for the first time, also proposed they offer PrEP. Groups at risk include:\n\nMen who have sex with men and who have a sex partner living with H.I.V., or who were recently infected with another sexually transmitted disease, or who do not use condoms consistently;\n\nSexually active heterosexual men and women whose sex partner is living with H.I.V., or who don\u2019t use condoms consistently with a partner who is at high risk for H.I.V. or whose H.I.V. status is not known, or who recently had syphilis or gonorrhea; People who inject drugs and share needles or other drug equipment, or whose sexual behavior puts them at risk.\n\nSex workers and sexually active bisexual men and transgender women and men should also be considered for PrEP, the draft says.\n\nPrEP, a preventive treatment regimen that interferes with viral infection and replication, is a daily pill that contains the drug Truvada, a combination of two medications, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC). (For pregnant women it is a category B drug, meaning no risks are known, though no clinical trials have included pregnant women.) Consistent use of condoms is also protective against infection and, unlike PrEP, also helps prevent other sexually transmitted illnesses.\n\nClinical trials that followed participants from four months to four years found PrEP cut the risk of contracting H.I.V. by more than half. But many people forget to take their pill every day and may not have adhered to treatment during those studies. The task force\u2019s draft notes that other analyses find that people who stick to the treatment have higher rates of protection. Public comments are being accepted through Dec. 26. The regimen does carry a risk of side effects that include gastrointestinal complications, mostly nausea; reversible kidney problems; and bone loss that can lead to fractures. Another concern is that people using antiretroviral drugs like PrEP could acquire or develop a drug-resistant strain of H.I.V. infection.\n\nAbout 80 percent of new H.I.V. infections occur in men, and men who have sex with men, blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately burdened by the infection. In recent years, H.I.V. rates have increased in young adults in their late 20s, as well as in American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian populations.",

            "Text": "State financial regulators in New York said Wednesday that they would investigate reports that gay men have been denied insurance policies covering life, disability or long-term care because they were taking medication to protect themselves against H.I.V.\n\nSuch denials would amount to illegal discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the companies doing so could be penalized, said Maria T. Vullo, the state\u2019s superintendent of financial services.\n\nThe investigation was triggered by an article published Tuesday by The New York Times, she said.\n\nThe Times reported that various insurers around the country had denied policies to gay men after learning they took Truvada, a cocktail of two anti-AIDS drugs, to avoid catching H.I.V. through sex. To get insurance, some men even stopped taking the protective drugs.\n\nThe practice \u2014 known as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis,\u201d or PrEP \u2014 is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Studies have shown that people who take the drug every day have nearly a zero chance of becoming infected, even if they are in a long relationship with an H.I.V.-infected person or have sex with many strangers without condoms. AIDS experts have condemned the insurance denials as both discriminatory and nonsensical, because they deny policies to good risks \u2014 men who protect themselves.\n\n\u201cThis is tantamount to penalizing applicants based on sexual orientation,\u201d Ms. Vullo said. \u201cInsurers cannot choose to deny coverage based on discriminatory reasons.\u201d She encouraged any New York State residents who believe they have been denied coverage because of PrEP to contact her agency, which oversees insurers doing business in New York.\n\nAsked if other states planned similar action, she said she did not know but believed California regulators \u201cwill be aligned with me on this issue.\u201d\n\nInsurers often do not explain why they turn down an application, but regulators have the power to ask exactly what criteria they use, to rule some criteria invalid, and to demand the records of individual cases, said Richard Loconte, a spokesman for the department. Bennett Klein, a Boston-based lawyer for GLAD (GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders), which is suing Mutual of Omaha for denying long-term-care insurance to a gay man taking Truvada, said the decision by New York State was \u201cterrific.\u201d\n\nAs news of his lawsuit spread, he said, he was contacted by men in various states saying they had experienced similar denials. He did not yet know of any other state taking action like New York\u2019s, he added.",

            "HeadLine": "New York Says End of AIDS Epidemic Is Near",
            "Text": "In New York, where the first cases of AIDS were reported in 1981, fewer than 2,500 new cases were reported in 2018, the lowest in many years. There was a time when the diagnosis of H.I.V. was a death sentence, when thousands of New Yorkers, primarily gay men, succumbed to AIDS-related illnesses, and the end of the epidemic seemed both medically and mentally impossible.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared that New York is on track to meet its goal to end the AIDS epidemic in the state by 2020.\n\nAfter decades of fearsome infection rates, the state in 2018 had just 2,481 new diagnoses of the virus that causes AIDS, a drop of 11 percent from the previous year, and 28 percent less than 2014, when the state began its initiative.\n\nThe governor\u2019s three-pronged plan to combat AIDS is centered around identifying, tracking and treating people with H.I.V. infection, including using pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, drugs that can drastically reduce the risk of contracting H.I.V. through unprotected sex. The governor said some 32,000 New Yorkers were now using PrEP, an increase of 32 percent since 2017.\n\n\u201cThis new data shows we are on track to meet that goal and continue our historic progress to finally bend the curve on an epidemic that has taken too many lives for too long,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. Experts in the field say that the progress being made in New York \u2014 particularly in New York City, long an epicenter of infection \u2014 is the result of a number of factors, including the use of PrEP and the ease of antiretroviral drugs, which suppress levels of H.I.V.\n\n\u201cThose two things together have been a revolution,\u201d said Jen Kates, director of global health and H.I.V. policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington. In particular, Ms. Kates said that the state and the city had embraced rapid initiation of antiretroviral treatment for those diagnosed with H.I.V., sometimes on the same day as a positive test result.\n\nThe new data from New York \u2014 where AIDS cases have been reported since 1981 \u2014 is striking when compared to the terrifying early days of the disease, when many otherwise healthy young gay men and others were stricken and died. State health officials say they believe they are on track to lower the number of new H.I.V. diagnoses to a little more than 1,500 per year by 2020. They are also seeking to get the estimated number of people infected every year \u2014 a term known as incidence \u2014 below the number of annual deaths, a metric that officials have said would signal an end of the epidemic.\n\nAt the same time that New York and cities like San Francisco have made major inroads in fighting AIDS, national health officials have been troubled by a leveling-off in H.I.V. prevention efforts, including in some rural areas and southern states.\n\nA February report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that rates of infection between 2010 and 2016 had remained stable among gay and bisexual men, who make up more than two-thirds of new infections, with a marked increase among Latino men. New York City officials say the strides there have been remarkable: In 2000, AIDS-related illnesses were the third leading cause of premature mortality. In 2017, the disease had fallen to 10th on that list. Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said that continued declines in H.I.V. infections was a result of a coordinated \u201cdata-driven, sex-positive approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been part of our effort at chipping away at the stigma,\u201d Dr. Barbot said, adding, \u201cNot only are we seeing decreasing numbers of New Yorkers newly diagnosed with H.I.V., but they are living long and thriving lives.\u201d",

            "Text": "President Trump\u2019s plan to stop the transmission of H.I.V. in the United States will focus on 48 counties where about half of new infections occur, administration officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe goal is to reduce new infections by 75 percent over five years and to \u201cend the H.I.V. epidemic in America\u201d by 2030, said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, who coordinated development of the ambitious plan, outlined by Mr. Trump in his State of the Union address.\n\nNew infections in recent years have remained at roughly the same level, around 40,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that the next generation does not face an H.I.V. epidemic,\u201d Mr. Azar said.\n\nOfficials have been planning an offensive against H.I.V. with the precision of a military campaign. They intend to deploy platoons of community health workers to step up the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infections. Mr. Azar said Mr. Trump would seek substantial new funds for the effort, but he refused to say how much.\n\nDr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency would make an aggressive effort to diagnose infections in \u201chot spot\u201d areas. \u201cIt\u2019s not an attempt to go for the whole country,\u201d Dr. Redfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to go after 48 counties out of over 3,000\u201d in the United States.\n\nOf the 48 counties, the top 10 \u2014 ranked by the number of H.I.V. diagnoses in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 are the counties that include Los Angeles; Miami; Houston; Chicago; Dallas; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Brooklyn; Atlanta; Phoenix; and the Bronx. Other targets include Las Vegas; Queens County and Manhattan in New York; Washington, D.C.; Detroit; Newark; Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties in Maryland; San Francisco; Baltimore; and San Juan, P.R. Mr. Azar said that new infections were \u201chighly concentrated among men who have sex with men; minorities, especially African-Americans and American Indians and Alaska Natives; and those who live in the Southern United States.\u201d The South accounted for 52 percent of new H.I.V. diagnoses in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\u201cAlmost 90 percent of new infections are transmitted by people who do not know they are infected or who are not being retained in treatment,\u201d Mr. Azar said, and officials see huge opportunities for improvement.\n\nHalf of people with H.I.V. have the virus at least three years before diagnosis, and one in four people with H.I.V. have the virus at least seven years before the infection is diagnosed, Mr. Azar said.\n\nDr. Jos\u00e9 M. Zuniga, the president of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care, representing doctors and other health professionals, hailed the new initiative. \u201cThe goal to end the U.S. H.I.V. epidemic is more than aspirational \u2014 it is achievable,\u201d Dr. Zuniga said.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the campaign against H.I.V. would use two strategies whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in the last few years. One is the use of medicines \u2014 antiretroviral drugs \u2014 to reduce the amount of H.I.V. in people who have been infected. When they take the drugs as prescribed, he said, they can reduce virus particles in the blood to undetectable levels, and in most cases they cannot sexually transmit the virus to others.\n\nSo the drugs not only treat infections, but can reduce their spread.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Fauci said, the campaign will increase the use of medications that help prevent H.I.V. infections. The drug regimen known as PrEP, for pre-exposure prophylaxis, helps block infection even among people at high risk for H.I.V.",

            "Text": "Scientists have long tried to duplicate the procedure that led to the first long-term remission 12 years ago. With the so-called London patient, they seem to have succeeded. For just the second time since the global epidemic began, a patient appears to have been cured of infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe news comes nearly 12 years to the day after the first patient known to be cured, a feat that researchers have long tried, and failed, to duplicate. The surprise success now confirms that a cure for H.I.V. infection is possible, if difficult, researchers said.\n\nThe investigators are to publish their report on Tuesday in the journal Nature and to present some of the details at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle.\n\nPublicly, the scientists are describing the case as a long-term remission. In interviews, most experts are calling it a cure, with the caveat that it is hard to know how to define the word when there are only two known instances. Both milestones resulted from bone-marrow transplants given to infected patients. But the transplants were intended to treat cancer in the patients, not H.I.V. Bone-marrow transplantation is unlikely to be a realistic treatment option in the near future. Powerful drugs are now available to control H.I.V. infection, while the transplants are risky, with harsh side effects that can last for years. But rearming the body with immune cells similarly modified to resist H.I.V. might well succeed as a practical treatment, experts said.\n\n\u201cThis will inspire people that cure is not a dream,\u201d said Dr. Annemarie Wensing, a virologist at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s reachable.\u201d Dr. Wensing is co-leader of IciStem, a consortium of European scientists studying stem cell transplants to treat H.I.V. infection. The consortium is supported by AMFAR, the American AIDS research organization. The new patient has chosen to remain anonymous, and the scientists referred to him only as the \u201cLondon patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to help the doctors understand how it happened so they can develop the science,\u201d he told The New York Times in an email. Learning that he could be cured of both cancer and H.I.V. infection was \u201csurreal\u201d and \u201coverwhelming,\u201d he added. \u201cI never thought that there would be a cure during my lifetime.\u201d\n\nAt the same conference in 2007, a German doctor described the first such cure in the \u201cBerlin patient,\u201d later identified as Timothy Ray Brown, 52, who now lives in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\nThat news, displayed on a poster at the back of a conference room, initially gained little attention. Once it became clear that Mr. Brown was cured, scientists set out to duplicate his result with other cancer patients infected with H.I.V. In case after case, the virus came roaring back, often around nine months after the patients stopped taking antiretroviral drugs, or else the patients died of cancer. The failures left scientists wondering whether Mr. Brown\u2019s cure would remain a fluke. Mr. Brown had had leukemia, and after chemotherapy failed to stop it, needed two bone-marrow transplants.\n\nThe transplants were from a donor with a mutation in a protein called CCR5, which rests on the surface of certain immune cells. H.I.V. uses the protein to enter those cells but cannot latch on to the mutated version.\n\nMr. Brown was given harsh immunosuppressive drugs of a kind that are no longer used, and suffered intense complications for months after the transplant. He was placed in an induced coma at one point and nearly died. \u201cHe was really beaten up by the whole procedure,\u201d said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who has treated Mr. Brown. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve always wondered whether all that conditioning, a massive amount of destruction to his immune system, explained why Timothy was cured but no one else.\u201d\n\nThe London patient has answered that question: A near-death experience is not required for the procedure to work.\n\nHe had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with the CCR5 mutation in May 2016. He, too, received immunosuppressive drugs, but the treatment was much less intense, in line with current standards for transplant patients. He quit taking anti-H.I.V. drugs in September 2017, making him the first patient since Mr. Brown known to remain virus-free for more than a year after stopping.\n\n\u201cI think this does change the game a little bit,\u201d said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at University College London who presented the findings at the Seattle meeting. \u201cEverybody believed after the Berlin patient that you needed to nearly die basically to cure H.I.V., but now maybe you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlthough the London patient was not as ill as Mr. Brown had been after the transplant, the procedure worked about as well: The transplant destroyed the cancer without harmful side effects. The transplanted immune cells, now resistant to H.I.V., seem to have fully replaced his vulnerable cells.\n\nMost people with the H.I.V.-resistant mutation, called delta 32, are of Northern European descent. IciStem maintains a database of about 22,000 such donors.\n\nSo far, its scientists are tracking 38 H.I.V.-infected people who have received bone-marrow transplants, including six from donors without the mutation.\n\nThe London patient is 36 on this list. Another one, number 19 on the list and referred to as the \u201cD\u00fcsseldorf patient,\u201d has been off anti-H.I.V. drugs for four months. Details of that case will be presented at the Seattle conference later this week.\n\nThe consortium\u2019s scientists have repeatedly analyzed the London patient\u2019s blood for signs of the virus. They saw a weak indication of continued infection in one of 24 tests, but say this may be the result of contamination in the sample. The most sensitive test did not find any circulating virus. Antibodies to H.I.V. were still present in his blood, but their levels declined over time, in a trajectory similar to that seen in Mr. Brown.\n\nNone of this guarantees that the London patient is forever out of the woods, but the similarities to Mr. Brown\u2019s recovery offer reason for optimism, Dr. Gupta said.\n\n\u201cIn a way, the only person to compare with directly is the Berlin patient,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the only standard we have at the moment.\u201d",

            "Text": "The \u201cLondon patient,\u201d apparently cured of H.I.V. infection, has gotten all the attention. But other recently revealed advances are more likely to affect the immediate course of the AIDS epidemic. The unnamed \u201cLondon patient\u201d \u2014 the second person apparently cured of H.I.V. \u2014 earned all the headlines. But other research released this week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections showed that scientists are making slow but steady progress on the tactics and medicines needed to fight the epidemic, especially in Africa. Monthly injections of long-acting H.I.V. drugs proved as good as daily pills at suppressing the virus, according to two trials involving more than 1,000 patients. In another study, Descovy, a new formulation of the H.I.V. treatment Truvada, proved just as effective at suppressing the virus, and may have fewer \u2014 or at least different \u2014 side effects.\n\nA study of the \u201ctest and treat\u201d strategy in one million people in South Africa and Zambia \u2014 the largest H.I.V. prevention study ever conducted \u2014 produced mixed results. Offering widespread home testing plus treatment to the sickest patients did reduce the number of new infections. But offering immediate treatment to all did not help as much as had been expected. And a study of pregnant women in Uganda and South Africa showed that a relatively new drug, dolutegravir, was better than the standard treatment for women about to give birth.\n\nThe results of those trials were revealed at the C.R.O.I. meeting in Seattle, a scientific conference held each year in the United States. It tends to offer more research and fewer theatrics than the International AIDS Society conferences that move to new cities around the globe every two years. Proving that injectable H.I.V. drugs work is important because many people forget to take their daily pills or cannot keep pills in their homes.\n\nThe success of the two injectable-drug studies \u2014 named Atlas and Flair \u2014 raised hopes among H.I.V. experts that these shots may eventually be used to protect the uninfected. (Trials testing that idea are underway now, but results are not expected for about three years.) Doctors working in poor countries are eager for injections or implants that will release small daily doses of antiretroviral drugs because the devices can be used in secrecy. Providing injections may be harder than handing out pills, but the option may attract patients with H.I.V. who would otherwise stay away. African women often say they cannot be caught with pills, microbicides, vaginal rings or other anti-H.I.V. measures because they fear that their husbands, lovers, family members or neighbors will mistakenly assume they are infected.\n\nLong-lasting contraceptive injections like Depo-Provera are much more popular in Africa than in the United States because many women must conceal birth control from their partners, who may get angry that they do not want more children.\n\nSimilarly, many gay or bisexual men would welcome a discreet way to take H.I.V. drugs because they are hiding from their spouses or families that they have sex with men. Both studies tested monthly injections of cabotegravir and rilpivirine deep into the buttocks. The shots worked, and only a handful of participants dropped out complaining they were too painful. Post-trial surveys found that 98 percent of the subjects preferred injections to pills.\n\nIn poor countries, cabotegravir may be especially useful because it does not need to be refrigerated.\n\nThe clinical trial involving Descovy, a new pill from Gilead Sciences containing a form of tenofovir known as TAF \u2014 instead of TDF, the form in Truvada \u2014 showed that it suppressed the virus just as well as Truvada did. People who take Truvada every day as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, are almost 100 percent protected against getting H.I.V., whether from unprotected sex or drug injection.\n\nThe trial, known as Discover, found that Descovy was slightly less likely than Truvada to harm kidneys or bone density, but other studies have suggested that Descovy is more likely to raise cholesterol.\n\nGilead said it will soon ask the Food and Drug Administration to let it market Descovy as PrEP. Some AIDS activists worry that people at risk will be urged to switch to Descovy just as low-cost generic versions of Truvada become available.\n\nTruvada has been very safe for most patients, but its high price \u2014 now about $20,000 a year \u2014 and the red tape needed to help the uninsured pay for it have become major obstacles to ending the AIDS epidemic in the United States. Gilead has already sold $33 billion worth of tenofovir; it is now shifting its new H.I.V. drug cocktails to TAF, which will remain patented \u2014 and, presumably, expensive \u2014 for many more years.\n\nThe trial in 21 neighborhoods in Zambia and South Africa \u2014 a region where H.I.V. infection rates are the world\u2019s highest \u2014 was designed to see whether infection rates could be dramatically cut if teams of counselors went door-to-door, testing anyone who agreed and offering pills to anyone testing positive. Counselors also offered advice, condoms, circumcisions, tuberculosis tests and other incentives to lower infection rates during the trial, which is known as PopArt and ran from 2013 to 2018.\n\nIt was assumed that communities where patients were offered treatment immediately would have by far the lowest rates of new infection. But they did not, even though tests suggested that more people there were taking their pills; further analysis of that quandary will be done, the investigators said. \u201cPopArt is a head-scratcher,\u201d Mitchell J. Warren, executive director of A.V.A.C., an advocacy group for H.I.V. prevention, said in an email.\n\nCombining the results of the two main subgroups \u2014 those offered pills immediately and those offered pills only when they showed early signs of illness \u2014 showed that these strategies lowered new infections by about 20 percent.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Warren said, offering treatment without offering PrEP at the same time \u201cis not the way to epidemic control. Frustrating!\u201d The pregnancy trial, called Dolphin-2, showed that 74 percent of women who got dolutegravir-based drug cocktails in their third trimester had no H.I.V. in their blood when they gave birth. Only 43 percent of the women who got older efavirenz-based combinations reached that benchmark.\n\nThat was a \u201chighly significant\u201d difference in how fast each drug drove the virus out of the blood, said Dr. Saye Khoo, an H.I.V. specialist at the University of Liverpool who led the trial.\n\nThat is important because many women in Africa find out they are infected late in pregnancy, and it can be hard to prevent them from infecting their babies.\n\nSome babies in each test group died, and a few were born infected anyway. The investigators believed the deaths were from unrelated causes like sepsis or pneumonia, and that the rare H.I.V. infections occurred early in the pregnancies, before either drug regimen could kick in.",

President Trump\u2019s 2020 budget request of an extra $291 million to fight the spread of H.I.V., experts said on Tuesday, will not be remotely sufficient to meet the goal he announced in his State of the Union address: to nearly eliminate the AIDS epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan focuses on 48 counties where about half of new infections occur, and seeks to cut the rate of new infections by 90 percent \u2014 from about 40,000 a year to about 4,000.\n\nVirtually all H.I.V. experts agree that his plan is medically sound. People living with H.I.V. cannot transmit the virus if they are taking a daily triple-therapy drug cocktail. And a two-drug regimen, in a single daily pill known as PrEP, makes it almost impossible to get H.I.V., even through unprotected sex or needle use. But the plan requires a vast two-pronged attack. All Americans with H.I.V. must be found, put on antiretroviral drugs and kept on them for life; and all those at high risk of infection must be put on PrEP for as many years as they are sexually active or using drugs. The cost of doing that will be daunting. About 1.1 million Americans have the virus, and about one million are in danger of getting it. Finding, treating and keeping them all in treatment, experts estimated, could add another $25 billion a year to the $20 billion a year that the federal government, by its own estimates, already spends on H.I.V. prevention and treatment.\n\nCalculating the total price is complicated, because so many expenses are tucked into so many budgets. One government agency does vaccine research, another does public education, and many pay for medical care. Mr. Trump\u2019s $291 million is discretionary spending; for example, it would help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do more testing and would assist local clinics in reaching more people at risk.\n\nBut one way or another, the drugs must be paid for, and private insurers will not foot the whole bill. Many of those affected are uninsured or covered under Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Affairs department, the Indian Health Service, the Ryan White H.I.V./AIDS Program or other government programs.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget request envisions giving the Ryan White program another $120 million next year \u2014 but simultaneously cutting Medicare and Medicaid by more than $2 trillion over 10 years. That\u2019s why Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are \u201cso problematic,\u201d said Jeffrey S. Crowley, a director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy during the Obama administration. Programs like those foot the biggest bills.\n\nOver the years, several administrations have announced plans to halt the spread of H.I.V.\n\nIn 2001, the C.D.C. said it would cut new infections in half within five years. (The rate did not budge.) In 2010, President Obama laid out his strategy, updating it in 2015.\n\nThe Obama administration did not estimate the strategy\u2019s cost, Mr. Crowley said. But an analysis of it in 2017 by experts at Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that the effort would require an additional $120 billion over 20 years, and that new infections would be cut by only 40 percent during that time.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan envisions cutting infections by 90 percent in half that time, noted Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the lead author of the Mass General analysis. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would use PrEP to protect the uninfected, while Mr. Obama\u2019s plan envisioned using only condoms.\n\nBecause those medications are so expensive, Dr. Walensky estimated that the total additional cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily reach $250 billion over a decade. When antiretroviral triple therapy was adopted in 1996, it cost about $20,000 a year. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has approved 30 antiretroviral drugs and a dozen one-pill combinations.\n\nBut the price has only gone up. A typical treatment regimen is now as much as $50,000 a year. Truvada, the only pill now approved for H.I.V. prevention, is $20,000 a year. At those prices, the drug bill alone for 2.1 million people would be $75 billion a year.\n\nThe next biggest item, Dr. Walensky said, would be laboratory testing. Finding most of the 1.1 million infected people in the American population of 325 million would require tens of millions of H.I.V. tests.\n\nThey cost only $10 each, \u201cbut the manpower costs are not trivial,\u201d she said. And various lab tests would cost about $325 per person per year.\n\nDoctor\u2019s bills would also mount. Relatively healthy H.I.V. patients cost about $3,600 a year in medical expenses; sick patients needing hospitalization cost $40,000, on average. \u201cAdherence\u201d costs \u2014 paying case managers and counselors to track reluctant patients and keep them on their pills, which can even include personally escorting them to medical visits \u2014 add about $400 a year per patient.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ballpark,\u201d Dr. Walensky said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a squirrelly figure.\u201d\n\nA representative for the Department of Health and Human Services shown a summary of Dr. Walensky\u2019s cost calculations declined to comment on it.\n\nDeep cuts in drug prices \u201cwould be a huge win in controlling the epidemic,\u201d Dr. Walensky said, because those savings would cover the counseling, testing, doctor\u2019s visits and other costs.\n\nThe actual costs of making H.I.V. medications are far lower than their retail prices might suggest.\n\nTriple-therapy drug cocktails considered state-of-the-art here as recently as two years ago are now available as generics from India for as little as $72 a year. (American taxpayers buy at those prices for patients in Africa through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.)",

            "HeadLine": "World Leaders Once Made Miracles, and Can Again",
            "Text": "Global programs founded in the 2000s have saved tens of millions of lives. We need new efforts today. We need a little uplift, a reminder that although world leaders today from Washington to London to Beijing may be dishonest vandals, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nEven flawed presidents and prime ministers can act in noble ways, and we saw that in the 2000s when George W. Bush, Tony Blair and others made a heroic effort to tackle AIDS and malaria and save children\u2019s lives around the world.\n\nEuropean and American leaders backed the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which since 2002 has saved 32 million lives. That\u2019s not a misprint. And some 17 million of those lives are from PEPFAR, an AIDS program that Bush founded.\n\nThen there\u2019s Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, created in 2000 with public and private backing: It has saved 13 million lives. We live in an age of miracles when a group of public health nerds, backed by world leaders and front-line health workers, can save lives by the million. These may be the greatest successes in the history of human governance. Only half as many children now die worldwide as did in 2000. That\u2019s five million children\u2019s lives saved each year.\n\nYet today the kind of global leadership we saw in the early 2000s is gone. Bravo to French President Emmanuel Macron for remaining a supporter of multilateral aid, but he\u2019s the exception. President Trump has tried to slash aid, although in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike have resisted, and Trump used his speech last month to the United Nations to preach nationalism.  I don\u2019t want to wax too nostalgic: Bush and Blair also collaborated in the catastrophic Iraq war. Still, at their best, they aimed to use their powers for a cause larger than themselves \u2014 while Trump, Boris Johnson and Xi Jinping worship only at their own altars.\n\nIn the heady days of the early 2000s, leaders pledged to donate at least 0.7 percent of national income in assistance to poor countries. The only countries that now do so are Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain. The U.S. donates 0.17 percent, and the average in the rich world is 0.31 percent.\n\nSo that\u2019s the conundrum: We have proven that we have the capacity to save lives, improve education and health, create opportunities for women and girls \u2014 yet we also seem to have lost interest. Nations around the world have adopted 17 Global Goals \u2014 quality education, zero hunger, gender equity and so on \u2014 to achieve by 2030. We have a historic opportunity to end extreme poverty on our watch, but that will require more commitment in countries like the United States and Britain, and also in countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOne ray of sunshine: Leaders at the United Nations last month committed themselves to achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Here in America, we\u2019re still feuding about access to medical care, but countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan are showing that moving toward universal coverage is possible even with limited resources.\n\nIf these countries can manage it, why is the most powerful country in the history of the world stymied? Universal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.\n\n\u201cThat was always haunting me,\u201d Tedros told me.\n\nUniversal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.\n\n\u201cPeople ask what keeps me up at night,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cMy nightmare is a pandemic flu.\u201d One way to protect against such a pandemic \u2014 and against Ebola and other viruses \u2014 is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.\n\nEbola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we\u2019ll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo. By some reckoning, half the world\u2019s people can\u2019t get simple medical care, especially surgery. I\u2019ll never get over watching a mother of three, Prudence Lemokouno, die needlessly in a Cameroon hospital because she couldn\u2019t get a C-section.\n\nLikewise, more than 800 women die wretchedly and painfully each day from cervical cancer, which in poor countries is sometimes diagnosed partly by the smell of rotting flesh. Cervical cancer is also overwhelmingly preventable with cheap HPV vaccinations, just $4.50 a dose, yet only about 15 percent of girls get the shot.\n\nI worry that in the coming year, Trump and impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the room, making it impossible for us to think of anything other than him. Trump is critically important \u2014 but so are the five million children who will die this year, mostly for preventable reasons.",

            "HeadLine": "Beijing estimated too high on HIV/AIDS",
            "Text": "China on Wednesday countered the long-held suspicion that it has undercounted the number of people with HIV and AIDS by releasing a new, more extensive survey that found the opposite to be true - that the country has actually overestimated how many people are stricken.\n\nThe new survey, conducted with the World Health Organization and Unaids, lowered the country's estimated number of HIV and AIDS cases to 650,000 from the official 840,000 figure released in 2003.\n\nMany experts and AIDS activists have long believed that China had at least 1.5 million cases, possibly far more.\n\nAt a news conference, Chinese and international health officials endorsed the new findings but also warned that China still has a serious AIDS problem that could rapidly worsen if testing, education and treatment programs are not expanded. Indeed, the survey found that while the overall number of cases is less than previously believed, the rate of infection is rising, with 70,000 new cases in 2005. Drug users and prostitutes transmitted the virus in most of these cases, but the report also found that the disease is now spreading from such high-risk groups into the general population, raising the risk of a broader level of infections. \"Almost 200 people are infected every day in China,\" said Wang Longde, a vice minister with the Ministry of Health. \"The situation is grave.\" With AIDS having already devastated large swaths of Africa, experts have feared that China and India, the world's most populous countries, could become the next epicenters of major outbreaks.\n\nThe lower estimate in China, if accurate, would place it in a far more enviable position than India, which is estimated to have more than five million people living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe Indian government has been criticized for failing to respond swiftly and effectively to the disease. Still, China is trying to regain its credibility on AIDS. Not too many years ago, top leaders denied the country had an AIDS problem and initially tried to cover up an outbreak in central China caused by a tainted government-sponsored blood-selling program. Since late 2003, China has mounted an aggressive nationwide campaign against AIDS and introduced pilot programs that provide condoms, methadone and even anti-retroviral drugs for free.\n\nThe joint effort between China, the World Health Organization and Unaids in drafting the study reflected the improved openness of Chinese health officials on the issue.\n\nBut that collaboration also underscored the fact that the outside world would probably be skeptical of any study conducted solely by the Chinese government.\n\nSome Chinese health officials had privately fretted that the study would be regarded as a whitewash.\n\nHenk Bekedam, head of the World Health Organization's office in Beijing, warned that China still faces a major AIDS problem and needs to raise public awareness about the disease while expanding prevention and treatment programs. But he endorsed the new survey \"as a more accurate portrait of the epidemic\" and described China's HIV status as \"low prevalence.\"\n\nRay Yip, the Beijing representative of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the new figure represented a far broader sampling.\n\n\"It's a more robust and more complete number,\" said Yip, whose office provided technical assistance on the study. \"But, by all means, it is an estimate.\" Some grass-roots AIDS activists in China expressed doubts about the lowered estimate. Chung To, chairman of the Chi Heng Foundation, which helps AIDS orphans in central China, questioned the reliability of the raw data used in the survey. He noted that local officials often hide the true prevalence of the disease, while many HIV-positive people lie about their condition to avoid social stigma.\n\n\"To me, it is hard to believe they are revising downward,\" he said. \"It is certainly not what I see as a front-line, grass-roots AIDS worker.\" Another activist, Odilon Couzin, who runs the Hong Kong-based China AIDS Info, an AIDS information and advocacy group, also was skeptical of the report's accuracy. He cast doubt on whether officials could count infected people among groups like prostitutes, drug users and gay men, all of whom are loath to reveal their HIV status in China.\n\n\"Frankly, in all of my experience, the quality of the data and the accuracy of the information here is not high enough to have confidence in this new estimate,\" Couzin said.\n\nOfficials involved in the study credit improved methodology and a bigger sampling of data for making it more accurate. The 2003 study made an estimate of 840,000 cases based on samples drawn from 194 \"surveillance\" sites around the country. By comparison, the new study used 329 national sites as well as several hundred other sites operated by provincial governments. Joel Rehnstrom, the coordinator in China for Unaids, said the new figures provided \"a better picture\" of the problem in China but should not be interpreted as meaning the situation is improving. \"This is good news, but there is still a long way to go,\" he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Shuping Wang, Who Helped Expose China\u2019s Rural AIDS Crisis, Dies at 59",
            "Text": "Shuping Wang, a Chinese doctor who braved the loss of her job as well as ostracism, assault and the destruction of her first marriage to expose the spread of AIDS in rural China, died on Sept. 21 in Salt Lake City. She was 59.\n\nShe died while hiking in a canyon with her husband, Gary Christensen. A preliminary autopsy indicated that the cause was a heart attack, he said. She had lived in Salt Lake City in recent years after settling in the United States.\n\nHer death came just over two weeks after a stage play based on her experience as a whistle-blower opened in London. Dr. Wang worked for nearly two decades in relative quiet as a medical researcher in her adopted homeland, most recently at the University of Utah. Colleagues, she said, sometimes did not know of her dramatic past. In the 1990s, she stood up to Chinese officials who had tried to conceal an AIDS epidemic in rural China. There, the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes the blood-borne disease, had been attributed to shoddy facilities that bought blood from poor farmers.\n\nDr. Wang was one of a group of Chinese doctors, researchers, activists and journalists who took great risks to spread information about the hidden epidemic in Henan Province and other regions. She was the whistle-blower who marshaled evidence of it. \u201cWang Shuping was the earliest medical worker to enter the fray in the war against AIDS,\u201d Gao Yaojie, a doctor from Henan, who become the public face of efforts to expose and treat the spread of AIDS there, wrote in a tribute to Ms. Wang. \u201cFor this, she suffered the most grievous attacks and pain of her life.\u201d\n\nEventually \u2014 far too late, in Dr. Wang\u2019s view \u2014 the Chinese authorities shuttered the commercial blood stations that had spread H.I.V. and offered medical help to villagers who had become infected, usually after they or family members sold blood. Dr. Wang\u2019s pride in what she accomplished was tempered by what she and her family endured. After she took evidence of the H.I.V. infections to officials and researchers in Beijing, her superiors in Henan assailed her. A former medical official, she said, used a club to smash Ms. Wang\u2019s testing lab and beat her. The local government shut the lab, leaving her without pay. Her marriage to an official who worked in the medical administration cracked under the pressure.\n\nThe play based on Dr. Wang\u2019s story, \u201cThe King of Hell\u2019s Palace,\u201d by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig, recently had its premiere at the Hampstead Theater in London.\n\n\u201cSpeaking out cost me my job, my marriage and my happiness at the time, but it also helped save the lives of thousands and thousands of people,\u201d Dr. Wang said in a question-and-answer exchange on the theater\u2019s website. \u201cI wanted to prevent disease, I didn\u2019t care about power and position.\u201d Shuping Wang was born Zou Shuping on Oct. 20, 1959, in Fugou County, Henan. Her mother, Huang Yunling, was a village doctor; her father, Zou Bangyan, was a math teacher who had been a soldier in the Nationalist forces that were defeated by Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists.\n\nAfter Mao began the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to purge China of purported enemies, Dr. Wang\u2019s parents were attacked because of her father\u2019s background, and her education was cut short when she was 8. She resumed school five years later, after she had left her home village and was adopted by an uncle. She took his family name, Wang, as her own. In 1991, after medical school, Dr. Wang began working in a plasma collection center in Henan. Her odyssey into AIDS activism began through her interest in hepatitis, another infectious disease spread through blood and other body fluids. Henan had nurtured a boom in commercial blood harvesting, recruiting hundreds of thousands of poor farmers to sell blood for a few dollars. Dr. Wang found alarming levels of hepatitis C among the people selling blood, and she worried that H.I.V. might also be spreading through the blood business. Her bosses scoffed. Chinese officials saw AIDS as a foreign affliction and were unwilling to accept that H.I.V. could spread among farmers selling blood. Besides, they said, comprehensive testing for H.I.V. would be too expensive, hobbling the lucrative business in plasma and other blood products.\n\nDr. Wang persisted. She used her savings to buy three H.I.V. test kits and randomly tested 408 samples for the virus. What she found stunned her: Thirteen percent of the samples collected from blood sellers had the virus, an alarmingly high rate of infection. The commercial blood stations worked cheaply. They took blood, extracted the valuable plasma and, through transfusions, gave the sellers leftover blood parts so that the stations could pay them less and the sellers could recover more quickly to sell again. The stations\u2019 equipment was often dirty. Worse, they often mixed leftover blood in tubs, then transfused it into groups of blood sellers, greatly increasing the risks of cross-infection.\n\nA local official at first praised Dr. Wang for her detective work, but soon retreated and accused her of lacking proof. She took 55 samples to Beijing for more tests. A virology institute refused to test them unless she paid an exorbitant amount. But Dr. Wang ran into a researcher who grasped the urgency of the issue and had 16 samples tested: 13 were definitely H.I.V. positive, three possibly positive. \u201cShe had the courage to keep collecting and sharing evidence even when officials didn\u2019t want information revealed,\u201d Zhang Jicheng, a former Henan journalist who helped uncover the spread of AIDS there, said in an interview. \u201cShe had no official support; this was her personal choice, and she suffered for it.\u201d Even before Dr. Wang left Beijing, officials in Henan called. \u201cYou\u2019ve stirred up an earthquake,\u201d she said one told her.\n\nIn 1996, the government quietly took steps to close plasma collection stations and introduce H.I.V. tests. But tens of thousands of people \u2014 and possibly many more \u2014 had been infected through the blood trade, and Henan tried to keep the epidemic secret. For years those infected received little treatment, and an underground trade in tainted blood persisted.\n\n\u201cCountless families were broken apart and ruined by AIDS, leaving many AIDS orphans,\u201d Dr. Wang wrote in 2014. \u201cThey had no one to turn to.\u201d",

            "Text": "The good news on AIDS: Nearly a million people began life-prolonging drug treatment in developing countries last year. The bad news: 2.5 million people were newly infected with the HIV virus.\n\nAs new infections continue to far outstrip efforts to treat the sick, the United Nations released a progress report Monday that highlighted both the notable gains in combating the AIDS epidemic and the daunting scale of what remains to be done. Unaids and the World Health Organization, two United Nations agencies, had initially set a 2005 deadline for getting three million people in developing countries onto treatment regimens, but that goal was not achieved until last year. In 2007 alone, the number of people receiving anti-retroviral therapy rose by 54 percent. Still, that is less than a third of those believed to need the treatment.\n\nThere was also significant headway in providing anti-retroviral treatments to help prevent women from infecting their babies with HIV during pregnancy and childbirth. About a third of HIV-positive pregnant women got the treatments last year, compared with 10 percent in 2004, with the greatest gains in western and central Africa, the report found. \"It demonstrates our efforts have started to bear fruit,\" Patricia Doughty, a program officer at the United Nations Children's Fund, said in a briefing by telephone.\n\nBut even as health systems geared up to prevent mothers from passing on the disease to their children, the needs of the mothers themselves were neglected. Only 12 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women were assessed for whether they needed treatment themselves. The statistics were laid out in \"Towards Universal Access: Scaling up Priority HIV/AIDS Interventions in the Health Sector,\" a collaboration of three United Nations agencies: Unaids, WHO, and Unicef.\n\nMore than a year after clinical trials in Africa found that male circumcision reduced the risk of heterosexual men contracting HIV by about 60 percent, \"many high burden countries are exploring how and whether to scale up male circumcision programs,\" the report said.\n\nExperts estimate that male circumcision, if widely applied in Africa, could avert two million infections and prevent 300,000 deaths over the next decade.",

            "HeadLine": "What Jonathan Van Ness\u2019s Story Teaches Us About the H.I.V. Epidemic",
            "Text": "The \u2018Queer Eye\u2019 star was fortunate to have a safety net. Too many people don\u2019t. In a recent profile, Jonathan Van Ness of \u201cQueer Eye\u201d courageously shared his story as an \u201cout-and-proud \u2018member of the beautiful H.I.V.-positive community\u2019\u201d who has remade his life after experiencing childhood sexual abuse, drug addiction and shame.\n\nAs a sociologist who has spent more than a decade interviewing women who are living with H.I.V., I saw in Mr. Van Ness\u2019s story the larger social and political urgencies of the epidemic.\n\nFirst, his narrative highlighted something I\u2019ve seen in my research: that sexual abuse is an unspoken driver of the H.I.V. epidemic. With its haunting afterlife, sexual trauma, especially when it occurs in childhood, destroys one\u2019s sense of self and safety.\n\nSitting across the table from sexually abused women in interviews, I came to dread a particular moment. When it happened, the vulnerability and pain in their eyes shook me. Several interviews in, I began to sense in advance that the moment would come \u2014 certain events they shared were clues, dropped like bread crumbs. By the end of my fieldwork, I could anticipate, almost to the moment, when women would reveal their secret. Among the 84 women living with H.I.V. from diverse racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds that my team and I interviewed, one in four revealed they had been raped or molested before the age of 25, and a stunning two-thirds of those with histories of drug addiction reported experiences of early sexual abuse. And these numbers are likely less than the actual incidence rate, given the trauma, shame, and silence associated with this experience. People who experience sexual assault in childhood or early adulthood typically do not acquire H.I.V. from the specific incident of abuse, although that does occur. Rather, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who have been sexually abused may be more likely to engage in riskier sexual behavior like exchanging sex for drugs and having unprotected sex with multiple partners, just as Mr. Van Ness described. These behaviors can serve as coping mechanisms or forms of self-medication. Women and men who have been sexually abused as children are also more likely to experience more sexual violations and may find it more difficult to negotiate sexual parameters in relationships, potentially increasing their risk of exposure to H.I.V. What we dismiss or judge as promiscuity is often pain in practice.\n\nSecond, Mr. Van Ness\u2019s story reminds us that as the floor drops out from under us, we all need safety nets. He was fortunate to have a supportive family, financial resources to help him start anew and a professional network that recognized his talents and steered him to the right opportunities. Unfortunately, that kind of safety net isn\u2019t available for everyone. In particular, people of color, women, poor people and those marginalized in many ways are much more likely to end up homeless, incarcerated, underserved by the health care system, or even dead than their white, male and wealthier counterparts. Transgender people are especially vulnerable. The television drama POSE, which chronicles the lives of black and brown queer and transgender people in the New York ballroom community in the 1980s and 1990s depicts this powerfully. The characters\u2019 struggles are compounded by the devastation of the early days of the AIDS epidemic as it killed people at an alarming rate because of slow intervention from the government, a lack of public compassion and no cure.For those who don\u2019t have access to resources, the H.I.V. safety net \u2014 which includes the Ryan White CARE Act, the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, and the Affordable Health Care Act, all of which help people remake their lives after an H.I.V. diagnosis by granting access to much-needed resources \u2014 is essential. Created by the early mobilization of AIDS activists, and now funded through public, private and nonprofit dollars, it is one of the most important and effective policy creations of the last several decades. Mr. Van Ness\u2019s story also has something to say to those who seek to defund and destroy Planned Parenthood. This organization helped to save his life by providing the information that he needed about his H.I.V. status. Four years after Mr. Van Ness tested positive, Austin, Ind. \u2014 a poor, predominately white, rural town located about 80 miles south of Indianapolis in a county that registered the highest per capita use of OxyContin in the state \u2014 saw one of the largest H.I.V. outbreaks in recent years. Among the many challenges thought to fuel the community\u2019s epidemic was the lack of available H.I.V. testing locations: Scott County had closed its only H.IV.-testing clinic, a Planned Parenthood clinic, in 2013. Just weeks ago, H.I.V. activists and those living with H.I.V. descended upon Washington to attend the United States Conference on AIDS. Their movement, with its roots in the gay liberation and civil rights movements, stands as among the most effective political mobilization efforts of our time. On the conference agenda was the Trump administration\u2019s proposal of $291 million in the 2020 budget to implement an End the Epidemic initiative which, if funded, would focus efforts on the hardest-hit communities. The goal is to reduce new H.I.V. infections by 90 percent within the next 10 years. The H.I.V. community is understandably skeptical and cautious, given the assault that the administration has waged against the communities most impacted by the epidemic: LGBTQ, black and brown, and poor. Given the effectiveness of available medications, and the ways in which H.I.V. has been transformed from a likely death sentence to a manageable chronic illness, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic. In recent years, an overwhelming body of clinical evidence has firmly established that people living with H.I.V. who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load \u2014 the amount of H.I.V. in the blood \u2014 by taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy as prescribed cannot sexually transmit the virus to others. But we have much work to do. Ending the AIDS epidemic means addressing sexual violence, and getting survivors the help they need to avoid self-destructive behaviors. Policymakers must provide the resources for increased H.I.V. screening and counseling in settings that treat survivors of sexual violence, and health care providers should screen people living with H.I.V. for histories of sexual and other forms of trauma and link them to appropriate services.  We must repair the safety net where it is tattered and establish it where it is nonexistent but needed, so that it works equally well for all populations. We must also acknowledge the inequities that drive the epidemic and find ways to confront the ineffective policies, vicious politics, social stigma and ignorance that can undermine even the best public health interventions. We must remember and serve those whose stories of resilience, resistance and survival rarely get the spotlight. Only then will we end the H.I.V. epidemic once and for all.",

            "HeadLine": "Recall of HIV/AIDS drug has many in poor nations in distress",
            "Text": "Last month, Roche Pharmaceuticals announced a global recall of its HIV/AIDS drug Viracept, after discovering that some batches had been contaminated with a carcinogen during a flawed manufacturing process at its Swiss plant. Patients should immediately discontinue the drug and switch to other medicines, Roche said, noting that the recall affected \"Europe and some other world regions.\" In Europe the recall cause little stir, since the drug has mostly fallen out of use, replaced by newer, more expensive alternatives. But tens of thousands of people take Viracept worldwide, most of them poor people with AIDS in developing countries. And in places, newer substitutes are not available to patients, either because they are not licensed or are substantially more expensive, said people with HIV and international health experts. In Panama, for example, a substitute drug, Kaletra, costs three times as much as Viracept. This has left patients with the painful choice of discontinuing a lifesaving medicine, or using a drug that might contain a dangerous contaminant. Roche, which had revenues of 42 billion Swiss francs, or $35 billion, last year, said it would cover the \"reasonable costs\" of the recall, but so far, patients or HIV treatment programs have had to make up the difference in cost. \"Roche has provided information, but there has been much less support in terms of who is going to pay the additional cost,\" said Dr. C\u00e9sar Nu\u00f1ez, Unaids coordinator for Latin America, who is based in Panama. Officials at the World Health Organization in Geneva and the European Medicines Agency in London said that Roche had not provided information they consider essential for safeguarding public health: which countries the tainted medicine was shipped to, the concentration of the contaminant and what the company will do for its patients. The European agency has canceled Roche's license to market the drug. Dr. Lembit Rago, an official at the World Health Organization, in Geneva, called the total recall \"sort of a disaster\" for patients in very poor countries. \"They failed in communication,\" he said about Roche. Had Roche been forthcoming about the countries affected and the lots that were suspect, this might have allowed a more limited recall, said Rago, the WHO coordinator of quality assurance and safety for medicines. \"It's fine for Roche to say 'withdraw and replace,' but there may not be much else at hand to substitute\" in many places, he said. \"This is not just about Europe.\" In response to e-mailed questions, Martina Rupp, a spokeswoman for Roche, said it had shipped \"at least one packet of Viracept with high levels of the impurity to 35 countries.\" But she declined to say which countries, as a matter of policy. High levels of the contaminant \"were observed in batches of Viracept that had been released to countries since March 2007,\" she said. The company made the recall worldwide \"in order to avoid confusion,\" she said. Roche has estimated that about 45,000 patients were affected by the recall. Rupp said that the toxic substance, ethyl mesilate, should be called an \"impurity\" rather than a contaminant because it was created in the manufacturing process and because this type of chemical can be found in very low levels in other medicines, although it was not supposed to be present in Viracept. \"Roche considers the risk to patients to be low,\" Rupp said.\n\nThe company was performing studies on the issue, but the results would not be available for \"some months,\" she said. At high doses, ethyl mesilate has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and at lower levels it has caused genetic mutations, but data are extremely limited. It is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.\n\nThe global market for HIV drugs is checkered with different drugs available at different prices in different places. HIV specialists now prefer Kaletra, made by Abbott Laboratories. It is in the same class of drugs as Viracept and has fewer side effects. But it has not been licensed in many middle-income and poor countries.\n\nAsia Russell, of Health Gap, a U.S.-based nongovernment organization that focuses on medical care in the developing world, said: \"It seems that Roche has abandoned these patients, since in many places there aren't ready alternatives.\"\n\nIn Venezuela, 3,000 people were on Viracept when the recall was announced, and the effect was \"severe,\" since many had no other options, according to Edgar Carrasco, an AIDS activist in Caracas. Alberto Nieve, another activist, said that Roche had promised to make a donation of another medicine.\n\n\"Most people are still waiting, they have not switched yet, especially outside Caracas,\" Nieve said\n\nThe company insisted that it receive a list of people who were on Viracept before it would make the donation, he said. People were also given little information about the risks of the tainted medicine, he said, and were referred to a Web site that was in English.\n\nIn the month since the recall, officials at the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization have said that they, too, would like more information from Roche about the dose of the contaminant and where exactly the medicine was sent. \"We have not gotten information - not even an order of magnitude,\" Martin Harvey Allchurch, a spokesman for the European agency, said. \"I understand sales figures are confidential, but I would have thought by now we would have this information.\"\n\nViracept had been sold in 49 countries since 2004, according to the World Health Organization, with over 12 million units were sold in 2006 and 2 million in 2007 before the recall. Canada, Japan and the United States, were not affected by the recall since another company, Pfizer, makes a version of Viracept in those nations.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency asked Roche to clarify what doses of the compound would be toxic in humans and to create a registry of patients exposed to \"contaminated batches of Viracept.\" The agency has no jurisdiction outside of Europe. Tido Von Schoen-Angerer, director of the essential medicines campaign at M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, said about half of the 400 patients who received therapy supplied by the group in Africa were on Viracept. The alternate from Abbott is not yet available, he said. \"So we don't know how many people are still on the recalled drug because there is no alternative,\" he said. The effect of the recall on patients is still being assessed, but would vary considerably depending on a country's finances and the organization of its HIV treatment programs, Rago of the WHO said. Unicef records show that Viracept was recently sold to Benin, Ivory Coast, Moldova, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and Yemen.\n\nIn South Africa, Brazil and Botswana, countries with relatively developed and well-financed HIV/AIDS treatment systems, there was little problem in switching away from Viracept.\n\nIn Zambia, the recall created a panic among patients who felt they did not get adequate information, according to the Churches Association of Zambia, which is a major provider of HIV treatment. \"It has been a month and people have been focusing on the recall which is not easy in countries where information and distribution systems are weak,\" Nunez, the Unaids coordinator, said.",

            "Text": "International agencies and national governments are failing to meet their goals to provide HIV/AIDS treatments in the developing world, according to a report Tuesday by the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition.\n\n\"The rhetoric from public health officials is good, but the follow-through is abysmal,\" said Gregg Gonsalves, who coordinated the report. \"We are woefully behind in our targets.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the United Nations and the Group of 8 nations set universal access to AIDS medicines as a goal for the year 2010, planning to have 9.8 million people in treatment by that time. But given current trends, the world will fall 5 million short of that goal, said the coalition, an international advocacy group.\n\nThe shortfall is particularly egregious when it comes to women and children, the coalition's researchers found. Programs to use drugs to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child at birth are reaching only 9 percent of HIV-positive women in Africa, even though the drugs are cheap and readily available, the report noted. \"Nothing has changed for women,\" said Anurita Bains, an assistant to Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy for HIV/ AIDS in Africa, at a news conference to release the study. Of children, she added: \"What we find in the report is that children continue to be neglected.\"\n\nIn a separate news conference, officials from the Global AIDS Alliance and the World Action Campaign underscored the same problem. \"Despite new investment, the world is not on track to meet basic goals adopted earlier this year regarding access to AIDS prevention care and treatment.\" In the treatment report, researchers looked closely at six representative nations with high rates of HIV: the Dominican Republic, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Russia and India. Progress in treating HIV/AIDS was disappointing in all of them.\n\nIn India only 5,595 children had even been diagnosed with HIV, even though experts believe that 200,000 are infected with the virus. In Nigeria less than 100,000 people were getting the anti- retroviral drugs that combat AIDS, though the government had planned to have more than twice as many in treatment by the middle of this year.\n\nChris Collins, a member of the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, said the number of people receiving drugs \"is dwarfed by the number of people in need.\" Advocates for people with AIDS say governments and international agencies are not keeping their commitments. The main fund that supports AIDS treatment programs in poor countries, the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, is already $1 billion short for 2007, Bains said.\n\nYoung girls are five times as likely to become HIV-positive as young boys, noted Mary Robinson, founder of the Ethical Globalization Initiative and a former UN Human Rights Commissioner at the Global AIDS Alliance news conference. Girls may be forced to have sex to buy food or to pay for education, the speakers noted. So HIV \"is about power relationships,\" Robinson said.",

Nina Martinez, a 36-year-old public health consultant, acquired HIV as a 6-week-old in 1983, when she received a blood transfusion in the years before blood banks began routine testing for the virus. HIV damages the immune system and interferes with the body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. \"I really want people to reconsider what living with HIV means,\" she said from her hospital bed two days after her operation. \"If anyone is proof that you can live a lifetime with HIV, that is myself. I've been living with HIV for 35 years -- pretty much the length of the epidemic in the United States.\" Dr. Dorry Segev, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the surgeon who performed Martinez's operation, praised her bravery and said that the historic surgery is \"really a celebration of HIV [medical] care and its evolution.\"",

Individual states that had passed laws restricting donations from people with HIV are working quickly to match federal legislation, said Segev, who help draft the HOPE Act.

Doctors knew the mother was HIV positive and administered the drugs in hopes of controlling the virus.\nTwo years later, there is no evidence of HIV in the child's blood. The Mississippi girl is the first child to be \"functionally cured\" of HIV, researchers announced Sunday. They said they believe early intervention with the antiretroviral drugs was key to the outcome.\nA \"functional cure\" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood. The finding was announced at the 2013 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta.\nThe unidentified girl was born HIV positive to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV positive herself until just before delivery.\n\"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby,\" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\nGay told CNN the timing of intervention -- before the baby's HIV diagnosis -- may deserve \"more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used.\"\n\"We are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently,\" she said on the eve of the Atlanta conference.\nHigh-risk exposure\nDr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay, called the developments fascinating, including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment for eight to 10 months.\n\"This is the very first case in which we've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound,\" Luzuriaga told CNN.\nOnce it was determined the Mississippi mother was HIV positive, Gay immediately began giving the infant antiretroviral drugs upon the baby's delivery in an attempt to control HIV infection.",

Sitting in a boardroom at AID Atlanta, an HIV outreach facility in Atlanta where she volunteers, she exudes confidence.\nBut Traylor is HIV positive.\nAccording to the CDC, 50,000 Americans are infected with HIV each year, and 25% of those are between the ages of 13 and 24.\nSixty percent of youth with HIV don't know they have it, despite recommendations from the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\nA faceless disease\nTraylor got her first HIV test as a teenager when someone living with the disease gave a presentation at her high school. She was about 16 and already a teen mother at the time. She knew she had been having unprotected sex and wanted to stay healthy for her young son. At the time, Traylor was in what she believed was a monogamous relationship. During her annual doctor's visit, she was disturbed to realize she had to ask specifically for an HIV test on top of a standard STD panel. She insisted on taking the test even though her doctor told her -- as a heterosexual woman involved in a monogamous relationship -- that she was low risk.\nLater Traylor broke up with her boyfriend and began a new committed relationship. That was the year her life changed. Despite vigilance in testing, Traylor wasn't prepared for what she found out at her doctor's visit that year: She was HIV positive. Two weeks later she learned she was pregnant with her second child.\n\"It was very difficult -- a lot of screaming in my head, a lot of tears -- as if I was going to a funeral every day,\" she said.\nThe father of Traylor's baby tested negative for HIV and she was able to give birth to a healthy daughter. Traylor believes she contracted the disease from an ex-boyfriend who has not been tested.\nOver the past two years, Traylor has come to a place of acceptance, and she takes personal responsibility for taking a chance with her health by having unprotected sex. But in hindsight, she realizes that even though she knew about HIV, she didn't fully understand her risk of contracting it.\n\"At home we didn't talk about HIV because it just didn't exist in my world,\" she said. \"I was aware it was out there, but I didn't know what it looked like.\"\nHIV doesn't have a face, and someone who is infected doesn't necessarily exhibit any physical signs.\n\"You think that you would see signs that a person is sick,\" she said, but since that isn't always the case, teens and young adults can feel a false sense of security. They may think, regarding their partner, \"we talk all the time, I trust them, so I don't need to go get tested,\" she said.\nTraylor wasn't always open with her status, but now she dedicates much of her time and energy to raising HIV awareness because she considers the often imperceptible nature of the disease a factor in its continued transmission.",

In 2010, the CDC estimated that 72% of new HIV infections in young people were transmitted through same-sex, male sexual activity. Fifty-seven percent of estimated new infections in this age group were in African-Americans.\nMichael Kaplan, president and CEO of AIDS United, which supports more than 400 grassroots organizations annually, said that as a young gay man he found it difficult to talk to his doctor about HIV testing.\nDespite seeing a doctor regularly for diabetes, Kaplan, now 44, said his doctor never offered him an HIV test and made assumptions about his sexual orientation.\n\"I would say, 'I don't date girls,' and hoped he might simply have a clue, but (he) never seemed to allow for the fact I could be gay,\" Kaplan said.\nHe said doctors need to create \"an open and accepting environment that talks about sexuality as human nature.\"\n\"The reality is, today, the majority of HIV infections are among men who have sex with men,\" Kaplan said. \"Without a doubt, we need broader screening efforts, but I think overall we need broader talk about sexuality in the United States.\"\nIf doctors aren't asking about sexuality and sexual activity, he said, then they miss the opportunity to recommend routine testing to young gay men.\nThe reasons that members of this community don't get tested vary, but there are common threads that touch youth across all demographics, especially questions about what love and sex means after a positive HIV diagnosis.\n\"What is sex going to look like? ... What is life going to look like? Am I going to die?\" These are some of the questions Diggs hears often from those he counsels.\nThe fear of stigma and isolation is great enough that it \"will stop people from wanting to know their status,\" he said, \"but it won't stop the sexual behavior that's happening.\"\nFor gay, bisexual and transgendered youth, he said, the fear of isolation can be intensified for those with strong religious backgrounds. They may feel their faith or community will abandon them because of their sexual identity. Diggs said he has seen this lead to risky behavior, and he urges parents to be involved early in an open dialogue about safe sex.\nThis includes recognizing that a message of abstinence doesn't always work with teens and young adults, he said, and recognizing that the conversation should be focused on sexual health, not just avoiding pregnancy. For a gay teen, he said, preventing pregnancy doesn't translate to safer sex.\nDiggs suggests moving sex and sexual health out of the shadows by making testing a regular family event and using that time as an opportunity to talk about the family's belief system around partnering, sex and marriage.\nBut being open about one's sexual health isn't always an easy thing -- a lesson Traylor has learned when she broaches the topic of dating. \"When I get to the point and I ask someone, 'Would you date someone that's HIV positive?' A lot of people can't answer that question.\"\nLearning when to disclose her status has become part of the learning curve for Traylor. She said being upfront earlier about her status has made things better. People respect her honesty and it makes the conversation easier to have.",

Their organs could save more than 1,000 people.\nA study by the University of Pennsylvania put the number of potential HIV-positive donors at nearly 400.\n\"The findings are significant because there are not enough organ donors in the United States to meet the needs of all of the patients who might benefit from life-saving organ transplants,\" said Emily Blumberg, a professor at the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\"Some of the patients waiting for organs are infected with HIV but never make it to transplant because they either die while waiting or become too sick to be transplanted.\"\nThere was more than a two-year lag between passage of the HOPE Act and Johns Hopkins' approval.

Two and half years later, doctors say the little girl still has no evidence of the life-threatening disease in her blood, despite being taken off medication.\nIt's a potential game changer in the fight against the virus that causes AIDS, and it happened almost by accident.\nThe unidentified girl was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV positive herself until just before delivery, according to a case report published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nResearchers: Toddler cured of HIV\n\"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby,\" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\nDoctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus. Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV positive. She said the baby had probably been infected in the womb.\nThe child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 15 months. Her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason, Gay said. The child has not received any antiretroviral drugs since that time, according to the report.\nIn March, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be \"functionally cured\" of HIV. A \"functional cure\" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood.Gay told CNN the timing of intervention -- before the baby's HIV diagnosis -- may deserve \"more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used.\"\n\"We are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently,\" she said.\nHigh-risk exposure\nIn March, Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay, called the developments fascinating, including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment.\n\"This is the very first case in which we've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound,\" Luzuriaga told CNN.\nRead more: Why youths aren't getting tested for HIV\nResearchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers early on is important, because they pass antibodies on to their babies.\n\"One hundred percent of (HIV-positive) moms will pass those antibodies, but in the absence of treatment, only 30% of moms will transmit the actual virus,\" Luzuriaga told CNN.\nHIV-positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases, Luzuriaga said.\n\"So all babies are born antibody positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventative treatment) or not,\" Luzuriaga said.\nNewborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if they are found to be HIV positive when they're close to delivering.",

Tests showed the virus in the Mississippi baby's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment.\nDr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center, was lead author on an early report about this case that was presented at a conference.\nThe early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said.\n'Like pulling teeth' to get doctors to test for HIV\n\"Prompt antiviral therapy in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,\" Persaud said.\nPersaud and Luzuriaga are part of a group of researchers working to explore and document possible pediatric HIV cure cases. The group was funded by a grant from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, and the National Institutes of Health.\nDr. Rowena Johnston, amfAR vice president and director of research, said it is \"imperative that we learn more about a newborn's immune system, how it differs from an adult's and what factors made it possible for the child to be cured.\"\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said in March that he was enthusiastic about the findings.\n\"The best way to either eliminate the virus or allow the immune system to suppress residual virus is to treat someone as early as possible after infection so as not to allow a substantial reservoir of the virus to take hold,\" Fauci told CNN.\n\"At the same time, you prevent the immune system from being severely damaged by the continual replication of (the) virus for an extended period of time,\" he said. \"The situation with a child born of an infected mother where most of the infections are transmitted to the newborn at or around the time of delivery provides an excellent opportunity to cure an infected baby, and this approach deserves further study.\"",

I've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find HIV in my colon, and they haven't been able to find any.\"\nBut Brown's case is rare.\nAnd the procedure, which is extremely dangerous, won't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus.\nResearchers tell CNN only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have this particular mutation.\nIn June, five years after he was \"cured,\" reports surfaced that \"traces\" of the virus had been found in Brown's blood.\nEven then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured. In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a \"sterilizing\" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely.\nRoutine clinical testing on the Mississippi toddler continues.\n\"We have formed a hypothesis,\" Luzuriaga said, \"and that is already driving the design of new studies and clinical trials that will help us to answer the question of whether by coming in very early we will be able to treat children for a while and then remove them from therapy.\"",

            "Text": "The number of children living with HIV is slowing down in areas of the world that typically account for the most new infections, the Joint U.N. Programme on HIV/AIDS said Tuesday.\nThat's proof, organizers said, that a program it created to get antiretroviral medications to pregnant women is working.\nThe program is known as \"The Global Plan Toward Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping Their Mothers Alive.\" It was created by a joint effort between UNAIDS and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The initiative targets 22 countries that account for 90% of the world's new pediatric infections.\nThe program gives antiretrovirals to pregnant women who are infected with HIV in those countries. The medicine prevents the transfer of the virus to their babies.\nSeven countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana and Ethiopia -- have reduced the number of new HIV infections among children by 50% since 2009. Ghana showed the most remarkable progress. The number of new pediatric infections there fell by 76% since 2009, according to a new report on the program. South Africa had a 63% decline. In South Africa and Botswana, transmission rates between mother and child are now below 5%.\n\"The progress in the majority of countries is a strong signal that with focused efforts, every child can be born free from HIV,\" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. \"But in some countries with high numbers of new infections progress has stalled. We need to find out why and remove the bottlenecks.\"\nOne of the problems may be the small number of women who take antiretrovirals when breast-feeding.\nThe report shows only half of all breast-feeding women living with HIV or their children receive these medicines to prevent mother-to-child infection. There is also an urgent need to improve early HIV diagnosis in children, according to UNAIDS.\nThe goal of the program is to reduce mother-to-child transmissions by 90% and to reduce the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths by 50% by 2015.\n\"Now we must all continue working together to see the day when no children are born with HIV,\" said U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Eric P. Goosby. This goal, he said, is clearly \"within our reach.\"",

Proceeds from sales of the clothing will go toward getting lifesaving drugs to those who need them.\nStella McCartney, Donna Karan, Tory Burch and Gisele Bundchen are just a few of the celeb mothers and designers who are participating. Shopbop, owned by Amazon, is exclusively selling the line, which launches Wednesday. Pieces cost $250 or less.\n\"Born Free is an idea that came from a place of deep respect for the delicate cycle of life. How incredible to be able to work with gifted designers, who as mothers recognize what the devastating loss of a child could mean and how easily that loss can be avoided,\" said Mutu.\nDesigners were given free rein to create with Mutu's prints. Each designer presented something for mother and child. Isabel Marant, known for her bohemian vibe, went with a micro-print on a peasant blouse. Jenna Lyons from J.Crew went with louche pants and a pleated girl's skirt.\nThe effort is the brainchild of John Megrue, chairman of private equity firm Apax Partners, who was concerned with the spread of HIV to the smallest and most vulnerable people in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThere are a number of private, public and international organizations on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa, fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Megrue's vision was to see private sector charities like MAC AIDS and mothers2mothers join forces with organizations like UNAIDS and PEPFAR.\nBorn Free was announced in November 2013 as an umbrella organization to raise money and distribute medicine where it's needed. With just one pill a day -- a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines -- a mother with HIV or AIDS can almost completely eradicate the risk of passing the disease on to her baby, according to Born Free.\n\"I am thrilled that the fashion community has so generously added their time, talent and voice to our collective efforts to meet the serious, but achievable challenge of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV by December 31, 2015,\" said Megrue.\nBorn Free will raise money via sales of the clothing from Shopbop, donations, and Conde Nast magazine subscription fees in May and June. One hundred percent of proceeds will be donated to Born Free, and the MAC AIDS Fund will match up to $500,000 of all donations.\nThe organization's aim is to work with governments within countries where the rate of mother-child HIV transmission is high to move toward solving the issue.\n\"We've seen incredible advances in HIV treatment, but to end the epidemic, we need to ensure all at-risk pregnant women are tested for HIV, and if they are positive, they receive HIV treatment so their babies can be born HIV free,\" said Nancy Mahon, global executive director, MAC AIDS Fund.",

            "Text": "There is new hope for potential transplant recipients living with HIV. Doctors at Johns Hopkins announced Wednesday they successfully performed the first liver transplant from an HIV-positive donor and the first U.S. kidney transplant from the same donor. The surgeries happened a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe recipients, whose names will remain anonymous, are also HIV-positive. The patient who received the donated kidney has been living with HIV for more than 30 years, suffers from hypertension and autoimmune problems, and had been on dialysis. That patient had been on the organ donation waiting list for years, doctors said.\nThe person who received the liver suffered from hepatitis C and has been living with HIV for more than 25 years. The hepatitis C did significant damage to the patient's liver, and that patient had also waited on the donation list for years.\nBoth patients are now doing well. The kidney recipient is home already, and doctors expect to discharge the person who received the liver transplant in a few days.\nUntil 2013, Americans with HIV were ineligible to donate a lifesaving organ. People with HIV did receive organs from patients who were not infected, but doctors were throwing away viable organs because they came from someone infected with HIV.\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equality Act, or HOPE Act, changed all that. Doctors at Johns Hopkins had worked with agencies to encourage Congress to change the existing law. Once the act passed, it allowed the agencies that oversee organ donations to change the national policy.\nStudies of organ donations in South Africa showed that the transplant success rate between HIV-infected patients was nearly the same as the rate of success in people who were not infected with the virus. But a couple of studies that ran in The New England Journal of Medicine did show that when it came to kidney transplants, the organ rejection rate was three times as high between HIV-positive patients. While it is unclear exactly what caused the problem, that study still concluded that kidney transplantation between \"carefully selected\" HIV-infected patients was a viable option. It suggested there would be similar rates of success with HIV-positive patients as transplants in high-risk patients without infection. With HIV patients in the donor pool, a 2011 study predicted there could be an additional 500 to 600 more potential organ donors a year in the system, giving patients about 1,000 additional organs. With more than 122,000 people on the waiting list for organs, some of whom have HIV, this means that people will have a much better chance of surviving their end-stage organ disease.\nCurrently, only one in four people get a donated organ. People with HIV infections who need transplants are particularly vulnerable, as \"they die on the waiting list even faster than their HIV-negative counterparts,\" according to Dr. Dorry Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who worked on this case.\nIn the two years since the HOPE Act passed, the National Institutes of Health worked with experts to develop the criteria and safeguards doctors would need to decide how this procedure should work, since there is still limited scientific research.\n\"It's a privilege to be a part of this effort,\" said Dr. Christine Durand. The assistant professor of medicine, who helped work on this transplant, added that she was excited and looked forward to extending this option \"to other HIV patients in need.\"\nSegev said that Johns Hopkins will teach the protocols that it used with this successful procedure to other transplant centers across the country. The team is also researching options for live organ donations.\nThe donor in this case was deceased. While her family preferred that she, too, remain anonymous, Johns Hopkins read a letter from her family saying that she always fought for the underdog and would have been happy to live on in \"the souls of so many\" who were able to survive because of her donated organs. The organ donor was from Connecticut and the donation was facilitated by New England Organ Bank.\nCurrently 100,419 people are on the U.S. waiting list for a kidney and 14,753 people need a liver transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.",

            "Text": "The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",

Sitting in a boardroom at AID Atlanta, an HIV outreach facility in Atlanta where she volunteers, she exudes confidence.\nBut Traylor is HIV positive.\nAccording to the CDC, 50,000 Americans are infected with HIV each year, and 25% of those are between the ages of 13 and 24.\nSixty percent of youth with HIV don't know they have it, despite recommendations from the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\nA faceless disease\nTraylor got her first HIV test as a teenager when someone living with the disease gave a presentation at her high school. She was about 16 and already a teen mother at the time. She knew she had been having unprotected sex and wanted to stay healthy for her young son. At the time, Traylor was in what she believed was a monogamous relationship. During her annual doctor's visit, she was disturbed to realize she had to ask specifically for an HIV test on top of a standard STD panel. She insisted on taking the test even though her doctor told her -- as a heterosexual woman involved in a monogamous relationship -- that she was low risk.\nLater Traylor broke up with her boyfriend and began a new committed relationship. That was the year her life changed. Despite vigilance in testing, Traylor wasn't prepared for what she found out at her doctor's visit that year: She was HIV positive. Two weeks later she learned she was pregnant with her second child.\n\"It was very difficult -- a lot of screaming in my head, a lot of tears -- as if I was going to a funeral every day,\" she said.\nThe father of Traylor's baby tested negative for HIV and she was able to give birth to a healthy daughter. Traylor believes she contracted the disease from an ex-boyfriend who has not been tested.\nOver the past two years, Traylor has come to a place of acceptance, and she takes personal responsibility for taking a chance with her health by having unprotected sex. But in hindsight, she realizes that even though she knew about HIV, she didn't fully understand her risk of contracting it.\n\"At home we didn't talk about HIV because it just didn't exist in my world,\" she said. \"I was aware it was out there, but I didn't know what it looked like.\"\nHIV doesn't have a face, and someone who is infected doesn't necessarily exhibit any physical signs.\n\"You think that you would see signs that a person is sick,\" she said, but since that isn't always the case, teens and young adults can feel a false sense of security. They may think, regarding their partner, \"we talk all the time, I trust them, so I don't need to go get tested,\" she said.\nTraylor wasn't always open with her status, but now she dedicates much of her time and energy to raising HIV awareness because she considers the often imperceptible nature of the disease a factor in its continued transmission.\nLove, sex and stigma\nJon Diggs, a prevention specialist and counselor for The Evolution Project, an Atlanta-based center that offers HIV and STD prevention, treatment, and counseling, calls teens' underestimation of risk part of the \"invisible syndrome.\"\nDiggs works primarily with black gay, bisexual and transgendered men, a community that is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. In 2010, the CDC estimated that 72% of new HIV infections in young people were transmitted through same-sex, male sexual activity. Fifty-seven percent of estimated new infections in this age group were in African-Americans.\nMichael Kaplan, president and CEO of AIDS United, which supports more than 400 grassroots organizations annually, said that as a young gay man he found it difficult to talk to his doctor about HIV testing.\nDespite seeing a doctor regularly for diabetes, Kaplan, now 44, said his doctor never offered him an HIV test and made assumptions about his sexual orientation.\n\"I would say, 'I don't date girls,' and hoped he might simply have a clue, but (he) never seemed to allow for the fact I could be gay,\" Kaplan said.\nHe said doctors need to create \"an open and accepting environment that talks about sexuality as human nature.\"\n\"The reality is, today, the majority of HIV infections are among men who have sex with men,\" Kaplan said. \"Without a doubt, we need broader screening efforts, but I think overall we need broader talk about sexuality in the United States.\"\nIf doctors aren't asking about sexuality and sexual activity, he said, then they miss the opportunity to recommend routine testing to young gay men.\nThe reasons that members of this community don't get tested vary, but there are common threads that touch youth across all demographics, especially questions about what love and sex means after a positive HIV diagnosis.\n\"What is sex going to look like? ... What is life going to look like? Am I going to die?\" These are some of the questions Diggs hears often from those he counsels.\nThe fear of stigma and isolation is great enough that it \"will stop people from wanting to know their status,\" he said, \"but it won't stop the sexual behavior that's happening.\"\nFor gay, bisexual and transgendered youth, he said, the fear of isolation can be intensified for those with strong religious backgrounds. They may feel their faith or community will abandon them because of their sexual identity. Diggs said he has seen this lead to risky behavior, and he urges parents to be involved early in an open dialogue about safe sex.\nThis includes recognizing that a message of abstinence doesn't always work with teens and young adults, he said, and recognizing that the conversation should be focused on sexual health, not just avoiding pregnancy. For a gay teen, he said, preventing pregnancy doesn't translate to safer sex.\nDiggs suggests moving sex and sexual health out of the shadows by making testing a regular family event and using that time as an opportunity to talk about the family's belief system around partnering, sex and marriage.\nBut being open about one's sexual health isn't always an easy thing -- a lesson Traylor has learned when she broaches the topic of dating. \"When I get to the point and I ask someone, 'Would you date someone that's HIV positive?' A lot of people can't answer that question.\"\nLearning when to disclose her status has become part of the learning curve for Traylor. She said being upfront earlier about her status has made things better. People respect her honesty and it makes the conversation easier to have.\nOther obstacles\nFor a teen, finding and getting to a testing facility can be a challenge all its own.\nAinka Gonzalez, prevention programs manager at AID Atlanta, said she has seen teens struggle to get tested simply because they can't get transportation to a testing facility. For a high school student, teens must find a location that operates outside of school hours if they don't want to involve their parents. And, if a teen tests positive for HIV, their parents may need to get involved anyway.\n\"Laws differ around the country, but usually if you do test positive for HIV and you're underaged, a parent would have to consent for treatment,\" Gonzalez said. \"If a young person may be having other challenges at home, this of course will amplify it.\"\nKaplan thinks easier access to testing is crucial. \"If kids got to a place where they were routinely offered screening ... they wouldn't struggle with 'Where can I get tested? Who do I talk to about it?' And a lot of the stigma would be eradicated,\" he said.\nThe next hurdle is paying for treatment. Teens who are too young to have their own health insurance and young adults up to age 25 who are on a parent's health insurance plan will likely need family support to pay for medication. Without insurance, they often need to contact the department of health -- an option Traylor, whose medication runs $3,000 a month, finds \"terrifying.\"\n\"At one point, I was so afraid that I wasn't going to get health insurance anymore that I stopped taking my medicine,\" she said, and hoarded medication because she expected a month-long wait for a doctor's appointment through the department of health.\nTo find HIV testing facilities in your area, go to HIVtest.cdc.gov.\nThe next generation\nTraylor feels her HIV education in high school didn't offer crucial information about testing facilities and local rates of infection -- information you can find on CDC.gov.\n\"In school we learn(ed) that HIV can lead to AIDS and AIDS can lead to death. ... It's a fear and that's it.\"\nToday, Traylor is raising two healthy children with the help of her mother, and is educating them early about HIV.\nThe education starts at home, but it isn't always easy. Traylor helped her 9-year-old son with a project on the stigma of HIV, but admitted she was nervous to talk to him about sex.\n\"I said, 'If mommy had HIV, what would you do?' He said he wouldn't touch me, he wouldn't kiss me, (or) hug me anymore.\"\nIt opened the door for Traylor to talk to her son about how HIV is transmitted. Though she didn't tell him her status, she explained to him that HIV and AIDS can't be spread though common contact, like hugs and kisses.\n\"Then (he) said, \"OK, Mom, I'll hug you. And I'll kiss you. I'll still love you the same.\"",

            "Text": "Shares of Lakeland Industries (LAKE) and Alpha Pro Tech (APT), two tiny companies in the protective gear business, have surged during the past few months due to Ebola fears.\nBut now there's a much bigger company that investors can buy. Halyard Health, a spinoff of Kleenex and Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark (KMB), began trading on Monday morning under the ticker symbol HYH. Halyard's stock was up slightly midday.\n\nThe company makes surgical gowns, gloves, face masks and other gear designed to help stop the spread of infectious diseases. The products are mainly bought by hospitals and other health care providers. Halyard also sells medical devices.\n\nHalyard reported sales of $1.2 billion in the first nine months of the year. The company is worth about $1.8 billion -- more than 13 times the combined market value of Lakeland and Alpha Pro Tech.\n\nKimberly-Clark announced the spinoff plans last year, well before Ebola was lifting the stocks of hazmat companies and biotechs working on treatments.\n\nHalyard CEO Robert Abernathy told CNNMoney Monday that the company has seen increased demand for its gowns and face masks in recent weeks and that there have been \"a lot\" of inquiries about Ebola readiness.\n\nBut Abernathy was quick to point out that the higher sales for protective gear may simply be due to the onset of flu and cold season and not Ebola concerns. The modest bump for the stock on Monday seems to show that investors are not going to treat Halyard like Lakleland and Alpha Pro Tech. Lakeland shares have skyrocketed 134% in the past three months, while Alpha Pro Tech is up more than 60%.\n\nInvestors seem to realize that the company has a much bigger business than protective gear and should not be viewed as a speculative stock to buy anytime there are scary headlines about Ebola in the United States.\n\nStill, a class action lawsuit was filed against Kimberly-Clark last week (just prior to the spinoff) regarding Halyard's gowns. The law firm that filed the suit alleges that Kimberly-Clark falsely represents some of its gowns as being \"impermeable\" and therefore can protect against the spread of Ebola. The law firm claims that the gowns failed industry tests.\n\nAbernathy would not comment specifically on the suit, but he did say that he stands by the safety claims the company has made about its products. He added that the company's protective gear does meet all the protocols set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLooking ahead, he said Halyard will need to focus more on research and development and that acquisitions may be part of the company's growth plan as well.\n\nThat makes sense when you look at the company's financials. Sales were down slightly in 2013 and fell again in the first three quarters of 2014.\n\nAnd that's despite the fact that many other health care companies have benefited in the past few years due to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. So Halyard's biggest challenge will probably be far more mundane than figuring out how to live up to day traders' insane Ebola expectations.\n\nHalyard will simply have to prove to Wall Street that it can successfully increase sales and earnings. If it can't, shareholders might need one of those Kleenexes from Halyard's former parent company.",

            "Text": "The West African country of Senegal has closed its borders with Guinea over fears that the Ebola outbreak could spread, according to the Senegalese Interior Ministry. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia.\nSenegal is located to the northwest of Guinea, which as of August 20 had 579 suspected Ebola cases, according to the World Health Organization.\nSierra Leone and Liberia border Guinea to the southwest. Those three nations have been the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.\nSo far, 2,473 suspected cases have been reported to WHO from those three countries and Nigeria. Nigeria now has a total of four Ebola patients under treatment at an isolation ward, bringing the total number of reported cases in the country to 14, officials said.\nMore than half of the patients in the outbreak have died. It's the largest Ebola outbreak on record.\nAnd still, WHO says, the numbers don't tell the whole picture.\n\"The magnitude of the Ebola outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been underestimated for a number of reasons,\" the organization said in a statement Friday. \"Many families hide infected loved ones in their homes.\n\"Others deny that a patient has Ebola and believe that care in an isolation ward -- viewed as an incubator of the disease -- will lead to infection and certain death. Most fear the stigma and social rejection that come to patients and families when a diagnosis of Ebola is confirmed.\" Corpses in these countries are being buried without determining cause of death, WHO says. Medical staff cannot keep up with the current demand, especially with the limited supplies they have on hand. \"In some areas, most notably Monrovia, virtually all health services have shut down,\" WHO says. \"Fear keeps patients out and causes medical staff to flee.\" Senegal is not the first country to close its border during the outbreak. President Ellen Sirleaf has shut most of Liberia's borders to contain the virus. The few points of entry that are still open are testing people passing through for Ebola. Guinea and Sierra Leone have done the same. Kenya, South Africa and others in the region are also limiting travel to and from the area. In its first statement on the Ebola outbreak, the African Union this week expressed its \"deep concern at the current situation, and its full solidarity and support to the countries affected by this epidemic.\" At its meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the group of African nations authorized the \"immediate deployment of an AU-led Military and Civilian Humanitarian Mission, comprising medical doctors, nurses and other medical and paramedical personnel, as well as military personnel, as required for the effectiveness and protection of the Mission.\" Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, describes Ebola as \"one of the world's most deadly diseases.\" The virus is highly infectious, and is transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, sweat and feces. Two to 21 days after a person is infected, symptoms such as fever, muscle pain and a sore throat appear. The fever then progresses to vomiting and diarrhea, difficulty breathing, impaired organ function and internal bleeding. Ebola hemorrhagic fever can be deadly in up to 90% of cases, though the current outbreak's mortality rate has been around 50%. On Thursday, residents in the Monrovia's West Point slum protested a government-enforced Ebola quarantine. An estimated 50,000 people live in the West Point area. Armed soldiers were deployed to keep the quarantine in place, CNN's Isha Sesay reported. Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, with 972 suspected cases and 576 deaths. Meanwhile, the disease's infectious nature has health officials around the globe on high alert. But so far, any suspected cases outside the four West African countries affected by the outbreak have turned out to be false alarms. Test results on a patient in California this week were negative for the deadly virus, according to the state's health department. Similar cases in New York, Ireland, Abu Dhabi and the Philippines have also tested negative for Ebola.",

The fifth, Reston virus, has caused illness in some animals, but not in humans.\nThe first human outbreaks occurred in 1976, one in northern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in central Africa: and the other, in southern Sudan (now South Sudan). The virus is named after the Ebola River, where the virus was first recognized in 1976, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ebola is extremely infectious but not extremely contagious. It is infectious, because an infinitesimally small amount can cause illness. Laboratory experiments on nonhuman primates suggest that even a single virus may be enough to trigger a fatal infection. Ebola is considered moderately contagious because the virus is not transmitted through the air.\nHumans can be infected by other humans if they come in contact with body fluids from an infected person or contaminated objects from infected persons. Humans can also be exposed to the virus, for example, by butchering infected animals.\nWhile the exact reservoir of Ebola viruses is still unknown, researchers believe the most likely natural hosts are fruit bats.\nSymptoms of Ebola typically include: weakness, fever, aches, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Additional experiences include rash, red eyes, chest pain, throat soreness, difficulty breathing or swallowing and bleeding (including internal).\nTypically, symptoms appear eight to 10 days after exposure to the virus, but the incubation period can span two to 21 days.\nEbola is not transmissible if someone is asymptomatic and usually not after someone has recovered from it. However, the virus has been found in semen for up to three months, and \"possibly\" is transmitted from contact with that semen, according to the CDC.\nThere are five subspecies of the Ebola virus: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) and Reston ebolavirus (RESTV).\nClick here for the CDC's list of known cases and outbreaks.",

After five additional cases of fatal diarrhea occurred in that area, an official medical alert was issued on January 24, 2014, to the district health officials. The Ebola virus soon spread to Guinea\u2019s capital city of Conakry, and on March 13, 2014, the Ministry of Health in Guinea issued an alert for an unidentified illness. Shortly after, the Pasteur Institute in France confirmed the illness as EVD caused by Zaire ebolavirus. On March 23, 2014, with 49 confirmed cases and 29 deaths, the WHO officially declared an outbreak of EVD.\n\nWeak surveillance systems and poor public health infrastructure contributed to the difficulty surrounding the containment of this outbreak and it quickly spread to Guinea\u2019s bordering countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone. By July 2014, the outbreak spread to the capitals of all three countries. This was the first time EVD extended out from more isolated, rural areas and into densely populated urban centers, providing an unprecedented opportunity for transmission.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, WHO declared the deteriorating situation in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which is designated only for events with a risk of potential international spread or that require a coordinated international response. Over the duration of the epidemic, EVD spread to seven more countries: Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Later secondary infection, mainly in a healthcare setting, occurred in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, and the United States.\n\nThe scope of this outbreak, both in terms of cases and geography, can be attributed to the unprecedented circulation of EVD into crowded urban areas, increased mobilization across borders, and conflicts between key infection control practices and prevailing cultural and traditional practices in West Africa. Engaging local leaders in prevention programs and messaging, along with careful policy implementation at the national and global level, helped to eventually contain the spread of the virus and put an end to this outbreak.\n\nLiberia was first declared Ebola-free in May 2015. Additional cases were found and treated, and the country was again declared Ebola-free in September 2015. More cases were discovered in November 2015. On January 14, 2016, Liberia again announced it was Ebola-free; however, cases were detected in March and April of 2016, and Liberia made its final declaration on June 1, 2016.\n\nAfter an initial declaration in November 2015, Sierra Leone announced a new case of EVD in January 2016 and declared it was Ebola-free on March 17, 2016. In Guinea, the first end of outbreak declaration was in December 2015, but additional cases were discovered in March and April of 2016. Guinea was finally declared Ebola-free in June 2016.

It was a horrible time. Ebola patients stood in line to get into hospitals that didn't have a bed to spare. Thousands of children in West Africa were orphaned. Burial teams roamed the streets carrying victims to crematoriums. \"We went through just a horrific epidemic,\" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who visited the country in August. \"It's a searing memory that many of us will carry with us for the rest of our lives.\"\nSomething else is seared in my mind, too: the realization that smart people failed to stop this epidemic before it got so terribly out of hand. The outbreak started in March, and when I arrived six months later, the response was still clumsy.\nOfficials in Monrovia, including ones from the WHO, held an elaborate opening ceremony for an Ebola hospital, but then a few hours later when patients arrived, no one came out to help them. Weakened by the virus, the patients fell out of ambulances onto the ground.\nA doctor in a rural county begged authorities for an Ebola hospital, but no help arrived. He was forced to build one himself, where he managed to save many patients. In another part of Liberia, a woman couldn't find space in the hospital for her four Ebola-stricken relatives and was forced to take care of them at home by herself. She had no protective gear, and so suited up in trash bags to keep herself safe. Why was gear unavailable? It was just one of many unanswered questions during my time there. Larry Gostin, faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National & Global Health Law at Georgetown University, gives the world an \"F\" for the initial response to Ebola.\n\"If the world had mobilized rapidly and decisively, we could have saved 10,000 lives, great human hardship, and enormous health and social costs in three of the poorest countries in the world,\" he wrote CNN.\nThree reasons are often given for this poor initial response: Ebola hit big cities, where people live in close quarters; the West African countries have a dangerous lack of doctors, nurses, laboratories and supplies; and it was difficult to convince people to put a halt to the tradition of washing their dead relatives before burial, which spread the virus.\nWhile all of those are true, there was something else going on.\nFrieden describes how back in March of last year, he tried to get his teams into Guinea, where the outbreak started, but he says WHO leaders there wouldn't let them in.\n\"We got all these crazy questions, like 'We're not sure your team is qualified, send us more CVs,' and 'We're not sure when would be a convenient time for you to come,'\" he said.\nFrieden Intervened, calling WHO officials in headquarters in Geneva. \"That's really unusual, for me, at my level, to have to call and say, 'Let my staff in,'\" he said. \"There's been maybe one other instance where I had to do that in my six years as director of the CDC.\"\nIn July, the CDC was allowed to ramp up the response, sending 50 staffers in just 10 days and 100 total by the end of the month.\n\"But our team was not particularly welcome there,\" he said. \"It was not a very comfortable situation.\"\nThe problem, he says, was that WHO leaders in Africa failed to appreciate the severity of the outbreak and were overconfident they could handle it on their own. \"We were surging into the area and the WHO said, 'We don't need you,'\" he said.\nAs those issues resolved in the late summer and fall, the CDC and others could move in and do their jobs. Gostin gives this \"late, belated response\" an \"A.\"\nIt eventually worked. Liberia has gone without a new case for 42 days, twice the maximum incubation period, which is why it's now deemed free of Ebola.\n\"The road to zero has been long and hard,\" Frieden said.\nGuinea and Sierra Leone each had nine new cases last week, a dramatic decline from last fall when each week saw hundreds of new cases.\nThere's currently an internal and external review of the WHO Ebola response. \"What WHO did or did not do will be examined by this commission and the results will be made publicly available for all to see,\" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. \"In parallel, we are currently undergoing an independent evaluation of our response chaired by Dame Barbara Stocking.\"\nAnd the organization is already making reforms to respond more rapidly and effectively to public health emergencies. \"We have an extensive program of work to implement these changes and will be reporting to the World Health Assembly later this month,\" Jasarevic wrote CNN.\nBut Gostin is concerned WHO won't do enough.\n\"I believe firmly that the world remains unprepared for the next epidemic,\" he wrote to CNN. \"The next epidemic, moreover, could be far worse than Ebola, and we are not well prepared.\"",

He witnessed families torn apart and entire communities destroyed and felt \"immense joy\" when family members who survived returned his kindness by inviting him into their homes. Spencer said that while he was in the hospital battling the virus, his friends called him from Guinea and asked how they could help him.\n\"They are the true heroes that we are not talking about,\" he said.\nHe also said that early detection and reporting of symptoms worked in his situation and that should illustrate the importance of sticking to protocols that health professionals worldwide are urging to bring Ebola under control.\nThere have been 13,268 reported Ebola cases in eight affected countries since the outbreak began, with 4,960 reported deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of these cases have been in three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nAbout 50% of patients in Africa who have contracted Ebola have died. Eight of the nine Ebola patients who have been treated in the United States have survived. That's primarily because, U.S. officials say, there are far greater resources and coordination in the United States than in West Africa, both in government response to containing the virus and in medical tools needed to treat it.\nHug from the mayor\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio welcomed Spencer back to his \"normal life.\"\nSpencer stood beside the mayor. De Blasio urged him to give the mayor's wife a hug. Then, de Blasio and Spencer embraced.\nIt's a \"good feeling to hug a hero,\" de Blasio said.\nSpencer had been in isolation at Bellevue since his diagnosis last month. At the time, the 33-year-old had just returned home from Guinea. He came down with symptoms shortly after arriving in New York on October 17. He was diagnosed on October 23 -- the same day that Doctors Without Borders reported that he had a fever. Ebola patients must be symptomatic to be contagious.\nReports that he went jogging and bowling, ate out and took the subway fanned fears that the virus could spread in the city. But authorities said that the risk of that happening was low.\nNew York authorities said there were strict protocols in place to handle an Ebola patient and to track those with whom he or she came into contact.\nDr. Laura Evans was part of Spencer's treatment team at Bellevue.\nShe said that when she was first called to help, she assumed that she was responding to one of the many Ebola drills that the medical staff had been practicing. She was shocked when she found out it was real -- that New York had its first Ebola patient.\nShe said it was an honor to get to know Spencer. He has courage and dedication, and she was inspired by him, she said.\nShortly after the press conference, Spencer went back to his apartment in New York.",

The challenge is not to let up, not to be complacent and to really double down,\" he said.\nLast week, the World Health Organization put the number of reported deaths from Ebola at 6,915, with more than 18,600 cases of the disease reported.\nAsked about the CDC's report in September that in certain scenarios, Ebola cases could reach 550,000 by January, Frieden said: \"The projections we released a few months ago showed what could happen if nothing more were done -- in fact an enormous amount has been done.\"\nHe said what had changed was the world's reaction response to not letting that happen. Liberia had the \"most hopeful picture\" of the three countries, Frieden said. \"As of today, it has the upper hand over the virus.\" This was due to the country's implementation of the Rapid Isolation and Treatment for Ebola approach, he said.\nExtensive challenges remain, however, in Sierra Leone, he said.\n\"Sierra Leone has by far the largest number of cases of the three countries at this point and is in a rapid scale-up phase.\" This is in part a result of the \"challenge of complacency,\" he said. As the number of cases fell, he said, health care workers were \"relaxing their grip\", by, for example, not wearing protective clothing or ignoring the possibility of Ebola infection when treating patients for other ailments.\nThree actions were important to combat the next phase of the outbreak, Frieden said:\nFirst, break the cycle of exponential growth. Second, trace every chain of transmission and ensure the intensive followup of every patient with Ebola. And third, strengthen the areas that were now Ebola-free to prevent outbreaks there, he said.\n\"The next phase is in many ways harder -- it's tracing every single case to break every single chain of transmission including in highly mobile urban areas and that's going to be challenging,\" he said.\n\"The problem is there are clusters all over and new ones popping up all the time. Till each of the three countries get to the last cluster, the last case, then we're at risk.\"\nA lot had been done to combat Ebola, Frieden said, but it was still a \"work in progress,\" with -- for example -- more French-speaking health care workers needed in Guinea to stop the spread there.\nTools on the horizon included a new point-of-care diagnostic kit that would allow health care workers to diagnose the virus on the spot -- rather than having to make sometimes arduous trips back from remote areas for lab testing of suspected cases. Frieden said that another new initiative in Sierra Leone would allow the vaccination of thousands of health care workers -- if and when a safe vaccine was developed.\nBut he said with new tools -- especially the vaccine -- \"we have to ardently hope that they work urgently, but we can't count on them working.\"",

Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army forces in Africa who is among those isolated.\nWilliams talks to CNN from quarantine\nWashington even dispatched a top diplomat, Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who arrived Tuesday in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. She told reporters her visit aims \"to show solidarity with the people of the region so that you know that you are not alone as you face this terrible epidemic,\" as well as to help Liberia emerge from the crisis \"stronger and more resilient.\"\nAfter speaking Tuesday to members of a multiagency Disaster Assistance Response Team, who have been in West Africa since August, the President offered a hint of optimism.\n\"The good news is that it's starting to have an impact,\" Obama said of such U.S. efforts. \"They are starting to see some progress in Liberia, and the infrastructure is beginning to get built out.\"\nStill, progress doesn't equate to victory.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are more than 10,000 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola -- almost all in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- and nearly 5,000 deaths.\nAnd those are only the ones that authorities have been able to count, in a region where health care access and record-keeping is limited. The WHO, the United Nations' health authority, has said that the mortality rate from the current outbreak, starting with the first death in December, is about 70%.",

            "HeadLine": "Obama strikes back at Christie on Ebola",
            "Text": "President Barack Obama hit back at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over Ebola on Tuesday, warning that quarantine policies based on fear could discourage US health care workers \"doing God's work\" in Africa to battle the epidemic.\nObama issued a veiled but clear public rebuke to the tough-talking Republican who strode back onto the national stage in a tussle with the White House on Friday after ordering the isolation of a nurse who had just landed at Newark from Sierra Leone.\nThe president warned that health workers who do a \"really tough job\" in Africa should be applauded, supported and monitored in a prudent fashion once they come back home. He said anti-Ebola precautions should be based on science not \"on our fears.\"\nThe public disagreement marked the latest twist in the odd couple relationship between the cool, no drama president and the no-nonsense governor, who bonded two years ago after Hurricane Sandy. Widening disagreements are likely if Christie decides to run for president in 2016.\nChristie justified his decision to contradict federal Ebola procedures by quarantining the nurse, Kaci Hickox by saying that the inconveniencing of one person was outweighed by wider concerns for public safety. But the confinement of Hickox, who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola, stirred a public relations mess for the governor and on Monday he relented and allowed her to return home to Maine for monitoring. Another governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York also climbed down on tough new quarantine rules under pressure from the White House.  But Christie remained defiant on Tuesday, saying he had no regrets over how the drama had unfolded in his state. The Ebola episode offers another example of challenges Christie faces as the Republican governor of a Democratic state with his eyes on the White House. He has to avoid alienating conservative primary voters -- many of whom are still bitter about Christie's embrace of President Barack Obama days before the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy ravaged his state. But he can't hew so close to the conservative line that he upends his image as a straight-talker willing to take on both parties.\nThat dynamic was on display Monday after Hickox was released. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Christie himself should be quarantined after again lining up with Obama on a key issue shortly before a critical election.\n\"Obama and his gang are flipping out.... so one week before the election, once again Gov. Chris Christie has caved,\" Limbaugh said. \"We need to quarantine Chris Christie, is what we need to happen here folks.\"\nStill, the White House that was once so eager to embrace Christie's post-Sandy bear hug of Obama's leadership is now rebuking the state's the treatment of Hickox, saying medical staff returning home must not be stigmatized.\nREAD: General, troops quarantined\n\"Her service and commitment to this cause is something that should be honored and respected. I don't think we should do that by making her live in a tent for two or three days,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday.\nThe jab was a reflection of how the political circumstances of both Christie and Obama have changed since their interactions in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Back then, with Christie seeking a thumping re-election win to set up a 2016 run, and keen for federal relief cash, he had sound political reasons to offer Obama a disaster photo-op \u2014 much to the fury of Mitt Romney's supporters.\nNow, with Christie seeking a national stage, polishing his reputation after the Bridgegate scandal, and keen to capitalize on Republican claims Obama is incompetent, it makes sense to stand firm on Ebola.\nPHOTOS: The Ebola epidemic\nThe White House noticed the shifting dynamic from a politician who now has more incentive to confront Obama than to embrace him. A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that the White House told Christie and Cuomo it was concerned with \"the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa.\"\nThe saga reveals two sides of Chris Christie \u2014 likely to be vying for prominence if he decides next year to run for president in a campaign that will likely contrast his abrasive style of management with the cool, 'no drama' persona adopted by Obama, which critics see as evidence of disengagement.\n\"What I think Christie did here was he managed once again, just like Hurricane Sandy, to reassert himself as a very strong and powerful leader, someone who will seize the bull by the horns,\" said Brigid Harrison, an analyst who has watched the governor's fast rising career from Montclair State University. In standing up to federal health authorities, Christie assumed leadership of those suspicious of Washington officials who insist their risk to Americans from Ebola is miniscule.\n\"Being an undeclared candidate in a hotly contested primary ... Christie's calling card is going to be that bold leadership \u2014 and he is going to show it time and time again,\" said Jonathan Jaffe, a public affairs consultant who runs a daily newsletter on New Jersey politics.",

            "Text": "A doctor who recently returned from Guinea has tested positive for Ebola -- the first case of the deadly virus in New York City and the fourth diagnosed in the United States.\nHere is a timeline of Craig Spencer's movements since he got back from the West African nation: Spencer came back to the United States last week after treating Ebola patients in Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders. He completed his work in Guinea on October 12 and left the country two days later via Brussels, Belgium.\nHe arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 17, but he exhibited no symptoms of the virus until Thursday morning, said Dr. Mary Travis Bassett, New York City's health commissioner.\nThe physician, who works at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, was checking his temperature twice a day. He has not seen any patients since his return. The 33-year-old did not have any symptoms just after his return, but he developed a fever, nausea, pain and fatigue Thursday morning, authorities said. He began feeling sluggish a couple of days ago, but his fever spiked to 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 Celsius) the day his symptoms appeared. Spencer was in contact with a few people after he started exhibiting symptoms. Ebola isn't contagious until someone has symptoms. Three people -- his fianc\u00e9e and two friends -- are being placed on quarantine and monitored, health officials said. \"They are all well at this time; none of them is sick,\" Bassett said. Spencer started feeling fatigued Tuesday, though without a fever, officials said.\nThat day, he visited a coffee stand and a meatball restaurant in Manhattan. The next day, he ran for 3 miles in his neighborhood, and took the subway to a bowling alley in Brooklyn. He wasn't symptomatic until Thursday, when he had a low-grade fever, officials said.\nThe bowling alley closed Thursday and its bar was cleaned and sanitized as a precaution, it said. Both the coffee stand and the bowling alley were assessed and cleared by health officials while the restaurant was expected to reopen Friday evening.\nSpencer also traveled on three subway lines. \"At the time that the doctor was on the subway, he did not have fever ... he was not symptomatic,\" Bassett said. Chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with him are \"close to nil,\" she said. Spencer is at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been in isolation since emergency personnel took him there.\nIt's one of eight hospitals statewide designated by Cuomo as part of an Ebola preparedness plan.\n\"We are as ready as one could be,\" Cuomo said. His state will be different from Texas, he said, where a Liberian man was diagnosed with Ebola and two nurses who treated him later contracted the virus. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, died October 8.\n\"We had the advantage of learning from the Dallas experience,\" he said.\nCDC issues new hospital guidance for Ebola Duncan, who had flown from Liberia to Dallas, was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Two nurses who helped care for him also got infected, raising concerns about the nation's ability to deal with an outbreak.\nOne of the Dallas nurses, Nina Pham, has been declared free of the Ebola virus while another one, Amber Vinson, is still hospitalized.\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city followed every protocol in its handling of Spencer's case.\nFor starters, Spencer was admitted to a hospital as soon as he developed symptoms, unlike Duncan, who was sent home with antibiotics the first time he went to Texas Presbyterian Hospital. Duncan returned days later and was hospitalized.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dispatched a team to New York to help with the case.\n\"We want to state at the outset there is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed,\" the mayor said.",

The nurses have expressed a lot of concern about how difficult it is to remove the tape from their neck,\" Burger said. Claim: At one point, hazardous waste piled up\n\"There was no one to pick up hazardous waste as it piled to the ceiling,\" Burger said. \"They did not have access to proper supplies.\"\nClaim: Nurses got no \"hands-on\" training\n\"There was no mandate for nurses to attend training,\" Burger said, though they did receive an e-mail about a hospital seminar on Ebola.\n\"This was treated like hundreds of other seminars that were routinely offered to staff,\" she said.\nClaim: The nurses \"feel unsupported\"\nSo why did the group of nurses -- the union wouldn't say how many -- contact the nursing union, which they don't belong to?\nAccording to DeMoro, the nurses were upset after authorities appeared to blame nurse Pham, who has contracted Ebola, for not following protocols.\n\"This nurse was being blamed for not following protocols that did not exist. ... The nurses in that hospital were very angry, and they decided to contact us,\" DeMoro said.\nAnd they're worried conditions at the hospital \"may lead to infection of other nurses and patients,\" Burger said.\nA hospital spokesman did not respond to the specific allegations, but said patient and employee safety is the hospital's top priority.\n\"We take compliance very seriously. We have numerous measures in place to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting,\" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said.\nConcern grows about the spread of Ebola\nThe Dallas mayor declined to comment on the accusations against the hospital.\n\"I don't comment on anonymous allegations,\" Mike Rawlings said.\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a statement following the union's claims.\n\"For health care workers in Dallas and elsewhere, the Ebola situation is extremely difficult,\" CDC spokeman Tom Skinner wrote.\n\"The CDC is committed to their safety, and we'll continue to do everything possible to make sure they have what they need so they can prepare to safely manage Ebola patients.\"",

His condition is stable.\nOn August 21, Senegal closed its border with Guinea over fears of the Ebola outbreak, the deadliest ever.

Those three nations have been the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Corpses in the three countries are being buried without determining a cause of death, the WHO says.

President Ellen Sirleaf has shut most of Liberia's borders to contain the virus. The few points of entry that are still open are testing people passing through for Ebola. Guinea and Sierra Leone have done the same. Kenya, South Africa and others in the region are also limiting travel to and from the area.\nOn Friday, the WHO urged countries to avoid actions that compromise Ebola response efforts, such as closing borders and entry points or banning flights. The measures isolate and stigmatize the affected countries, making it difficult to transport supplies, the organization said via Twitter.\nThe crisis has taken a heavy toll on health workers caring for those struck down by the virus.

Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States.\n\"We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,\" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air.\nHe described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements:\nAn exoskeleton -- The metal frame follows the contours of the jet, creating a space set off from the rest of the cabin. Air is filtered as it enters the unit and as it leaves.\nA liner -- The liner is hung from the exoskeleton. It's made from a special heavy-duty plastic. The liner is the main device that keeps fluids and contagions from getting into the aircraft itself.\nEverything else -- Items inside the liner are designed for single use. They include a stretcher, a toilet, lights and a communications system.\nOnce the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours.\nEverything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed.\n\"We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,\" Thompson said.\nPhoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu.\nIt took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again.\nHe got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment.

            "HeadLine": "Texas hospital's misleading Ebola statements",
            "Text": "No doubt, this has been a trying time for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\nFirst, health care workers at the facility sent a feverish Thomas Eric Duncan home the first time he came to the emergency room, even though he'd informed the nurse he'd recently been in Africa.\nThen, after Duncan was admitted and diagnosed with Ebola, two of the nurses who were closely involved in his care contracted the deadly virus.\nEarlier this month, Barclay Berden, the CEO of Texas Health Resources, said the hospital had \"made mistakes\" and \"we are deeply sorry.\"\nThe mistakes go beyond Duncan's care. While attempting to explain what happened, the hospital has made some confusing and sometimes misleading statements. Here are some of them:\n1. Hospital blamed electronic health record for travel history info not being relayed\nThe hospital initially said Duncan told the ER nurse that he'd been to Africa, but somehow that piece of information never got transmitted to the doctors who cared for him.\nIn an October 2 statement, hospital officials said a \"flaw\" in the electronic health record kept notes on a patient's travel history in the \"nursing workflow\" part of the record and explained that such information \"would not automatically appear in the physician's standard workflow.\"\nThe next day, the hospital issued a \"clarification,\" saying there was no flaw in the electronic health record and the travel history was available to the doctors.\n\"In our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently, we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected,\" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in explaining the about-face.\n2. Presbyterian neglected to mention Duncan had a high temperature\nIn a statement October 4, hospital officials said that when Duncan arrived at the emergency room on September 25, he had a temperature of 100.1 degrees. That's lower than the CDC's threshold for Ebola, which is 100.5 degrees.\nWhat they knew -- but left out of their statement -- was the fact that during that visit, Duncan's temperature shot up to 103 degrees. That was only revealed when journalists gained access to Duncan's medical records.\nWhen asked to explain the omission, Watson wrote in an email: \"At 10:30 p.m. on September 25, Mr. Duncan presented to the Texas Health Dallas Emergency Department with a fever of 100.1\u00b0F, abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea, and headache -- symptoms that could be associated with many other illnesses. He was examined and underwent numerous tests over a period of four hours. During his time in the (emergency department), his temperature spiked to 103\u00b0F, but later dropped to 101.2. He was discharged early on the morning of September 26.\n3. Hospital has never fully explained why it took days to get an experimental drug\nIn caring for a patient with Ebola, the sooner treatment begins, the better -- even just a day or two can make a difference. Quick treatment helps explain why every other U.S. Ebola patient besides Duncan survived.\nPresbyterian did not ask for permission to use brincidofovir, an experimental drug, until three days after Duncan was diagnosed with the virus. By then, Duncan had been sick for 10 days.\nIn contrast, the University of Nebraska Medical Center asked for brincidofovir the day after the hospital was informed that NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was headed to that facility. He received the drug the day he arrived.\nWhen asked to explain why it took three days to ask for brincidofovir, Dr. Gary Weinstein, a pulmonologist at Presbyterian, told Dallas TV station WFAA that there was a lot of discussion about exactly which experimental medication could be used for the patient, and when it was decided to request brincidofovir, the drug had to be \"located.\"\nIt's been widely reported that research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health has shown that brincidofovir has shown some promise in fighting Ebola.\nWeinstein also told WFAA that \"there's a lot of hoops and paperwork and email and consensus that had to be done\" in order to obtain brincidofovir.\nBut the process to get it was actually quite fast. The Food and Drug Administration only took a little more than an hour to approve Presbyterian's October 3rd request to use brincidofovir, according to Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman for the agency. And Chimerix, the biopharmaceutical company that makes the drug, expedited a shipment of brincidofovir and Duncan received it the next day.\n4. Presbyterian won't say how long it waited to seek a blood transfusion for Duncan\nA blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor is another weapon in the fight against the virus. The University of Nebraska Medical Center asked for and received plasma from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly on October 7, the day after Mukpo arrived at that hospital.\nThe Dallas hospital has declined to say when it approached Brantly or the other potential donor in the United States, Nancy Writebol, who had also been successfully treated for Ebola. Palmer Holt, a spokesman for the missionary group SIM, said Writebol was approached on October 4 about donating to Duncan. That's four days after he was diagnosed with Ebola.\nBut it turned out that neither Writebol nor Brantly -- who both contracted Ebola while working for SIM in Liberia -- were a match for Duncan.\n5. Presbyterian laid the blame for safety problems on the CDC\nThe Dallas hospital has still not explained how two of its nurses -- Nina Pham and Amber Vinson -- became infected with Ebola after having cared for Duncan.\nThe hospital said the CDC guidelines for protective gear worn by health care workers changed frequently, and this was \"frustrating\" to hospital employees and management.\nWhile the CDC guidelines for protective gear have indeed changed and been called into question, two other hospitals -- in Georgia and Nebraska -- have taken care of seven Ebola patients without a single health care worker getting sick.\nPresbyterian hasn't explained why those hospitals succeeded while it failed.\n\"A lot is being said about what may or may not have occurred,\" said Watson, the Presbyterian spokesman. \"They were using full protective measures under the CDC guidelines, so we don't yet know precisely how or when they were infected. But it's clear there was an exposure somewhere, sometime in their treatment of Mr. Duncan.\"",

The Charlotte, North Carolina, residents have been in Liberia since August 2013, according to the blog Writebols2Liberia. They have two adult children. On Saturday, Samaritan's Purse announced that American doctor Kent Brantly had become infected. The 33-year-old former Indianapolis resident had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia and started feeling ill, spokeswoman Melissa Strickland said. Once he started noticing the symptoms last week, Brantly isolated himself.\nBrantly, the medical director for Samaritan Purse's Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, has been in the country since October, Strickland said.\n\"When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients,\" she said.\nDeadliest Ebola outbreak\nHealth officials say the Ebola outbreak, centered in West Africa, is the deadliest ever.\nAs of July 20, some 1,093 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are thought to have been infected by Ebola since its symptoms were first observed four months ago, according to the World Health Organization.\nTesting confirmed the Ebola virus in 786 of those cases; 442 of those people died. Of the 1,093 confirmed, probable and suspected cases, 660 people have died.\nThere also are fears the virus could spread to Africa's most populous country, Nigeria.\nLast week, a Liberian man hospitalized with Ebola in Lagos died, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said.\nLagos, the largest city in Nigeria, has a population of more than 20 million.\nThe man arrived at Lagos airport on July 20 and was isolated in a local hospital after showing symptoms associated with the virus. He told officials he had no direct contact with anyone with the virus nor had he attended the burial of anyone who died of Ebola.\nAnother doctor infected\nConfirmation of the death in Lagos came after news that a doctor who has played a key role in fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is infected with the disease, according to that country's Ministry of Health.\nDr. Sheik Humarr Khan is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, agency spokesman Tim Shenk said.\nBefore falling ill, Khan had been overseeing Ebola treatment and isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of the capital, Freetown.\nEbola typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% because of early treatment.",

            "Text": "Two American missionaries infected with the deadly Ebola virus were given an experimental drug.\nShortly after, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were flown separately from Liberia to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital -- the first human patients with Ebola to ever come to the United States.\nWritebol was released from the hospital Tuesday. On Thursday morning, Brantly walked out of that same hospital with no signs of the virus in his system, doctors say.\nTheir recoveries seem to offer hope for those fighting the largest Ebola outbreak in known history. More than 2,400 people have been infected by the virus, according to the World Health Organization, and it's killed more than half.\nBut ZMapp is not an approved treatment for Ebola; in fact, no approved, proven treatment exists. So governments, aid organizations and scientists around the globe are racing to find a way to stop the virus. Here are answers to questions about Ebola patients and treatments for the disease.\n1. Are Brantly and Writebol cured?\nMostly. For Ebola patients to leave isolation, two blood tests had to come back negative for the Ebola virus. So their bodily fluids, like blood, sweat and feces, are no longer infectious.\n\"Nancy is free of the virus, but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition,\" Writebol's husband, David Writebol, said in a statement.\nSome doctors believe the virus can remain in vaginal fluid and semen for up to several months, according to WHO. Dr. Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease specialist at Emory, said there is no evidence Ebola has ever been transmitted this way, but the risk was discussed with both patients.\n2. Are they now immune to Ebola?\nDoctors believe surviving Ebola leaves you immune to future infection. Scientists have found that people who survive Ebola have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future, and possibly against other strains as well.\nBut, as you can imagine, they haven't tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again.\nThere are four Ebola strains known to infect humans; the Zaire ebolavirus causing the current outbreak is the most common.\n3. Who else has been given ZMapp?\nThe Ebola drug was flown to Spain to give to a priest named Miguel Pajares, who had contracted the virus in Liberia. Pajares died on August 12. It's unclear if he was given the drug before he died.\nZMapp appears to be helping three Liberian health care workers who were given the experimental drug. They have shown \"very positive signs of recovery,\" the Liberian Ministry of Health said earlier this week. Medical professionals treating the workers have called their progress \"remarkable.\"\n4. Who makes the drug?\nThe drug was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., which is based in San Diego. The company was founded in 2003 \"to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense,\" according to its website.\nMapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction, to develop an Ebola treatment for several years.\n5. How does ZMapp work?\nAntibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign, or harmful, cells. A monoclonal antibody is similar, except it's engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell, according to the Mayo Clinic, mimicking your immune system's natural response. Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions.\nSources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a three-mouse monoclonal antibody, meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus, and then the antibodies generated within the mice's blood were harvested to create the medicine.\nHowever, the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants. ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro provided limited quantities of this kind of the drug to Emory, according to company spokesman David Howard.\n6. Did doctors know it would work in humans?\nNo. The drug had shown promise in primates, but even in those experiments, just eight monkeys received the treatment. In any case, the human immune system can react differently than primates', which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use.\nThese cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems.\n7. Are there other Ebola treatments out there?\nSeveral experimental drugs are in development, but none has been effective in humans.\nThe market for these drugs is small -- Ebola is a rare disease, almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies.\nIn March, the NIH awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight Ebola. On Wednesday, Wellcome Trust and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development announced money for Ebola research will be made available from a $10.8 million initiative.\n8. Will ZMapp or these other drugs be given to more Ebola patients?\nAn ethics panel convened by the World Health Organization concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one, but that doesn't mean it will happen.\nRolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult, Doctors Without Borders says. Experimental drugs typically are not mass-produced, and tracking the success of such a drug, if used, would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce.\nIn an opinion article published in the journal Nature this week, epidemiologist Oliver Brady says up to 30,000 people in West Africa would have so far required treatment in this outbreak if it was available.\n9. What about an Ebola vaccine?\nFor the record, \"vaccine\" and \"treatment\" are not interchangeable terms. A vaccine is given to prevent infection, whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms.\nThere are several Ebola vaccines in development.\nThe Canadian government has donated between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO. The drug, called VSV-EBOV, is Canadian-made and owned, having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory.\nIt's never been tested on humans \"but has shown promise in animal research,\" the agency says. We don't know if the vaccine has been given to anyone on the ground.\nThe NIH says a safety trial of an Ebola vaccine will start as early as September.",

The policy Christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad, he said.\n\"We need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests,\" he said.\nIn a Sunday evening news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commented briefly on Hickox's case, saying that \"what happened to her was inappropriate.\"\n\"This hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction.\"\n\"We owe her better than that, and all the people who do this work, better than that,\" he added.\nEbola gets political\n'To put me in prison is just inhumane'\nHickox arrived in Newark Liberty Airport on Friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital. She was put in an isolation tent inside University Hospital in Newark. She's twice tested negative for Ebola, including a test at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.\nHickox says she has asked repeatedly but hasn't been told how long she'll be held at the hospital.\n\"To put me in prison,\" she said, \"is just inhumane.\"\nOn Sunday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he was changing the state's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the Ebola zone. People who worked with Ebola patients but don't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home, the governor's office said.\nChristie spokesman Kevin Roberts said late Sunday night: \"The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home. Nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey.\"\nOn Fox News Sunday morning, Christie said he had \"no second thoughts\" about New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for health care workers.\n\"I believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they've been directly exposed to people with the virus,\" he said.\nChristie also told \"Fox News Sunday\" that a voluntary system of quarantine isn't reliable.\n\"I don't believe that when you're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system; this is the government's job.\"\nAt a news conference Saturday, the governor said, \"I'm sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced, but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much, much greater concern of mine. I hope she recovers quickly.\"\nHickox said she has nothing to recover from. Her temperature is normal, and she feels fine.\n\"Everyone keeps asking how I'm feeling physically and of course I'm fine physically, but I don't think most people understand what it's like to be alone in a tent and decisions are being made that don't make sense and show no compassion,\" Hickox said, starting to cry.\n\"I just feel like fear is winning right now, and when fear wins, everyone loses.\"\nHer life in quarantine\nShe's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper scrubs to wear. Hickox said she has no shower, no flushable toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material. Mostly, she says, she stares at the walls.\nOn Sunday afternoon, the hospital issued an update saying \"the patient has computer access, use of her cell phone, reading material (magazines, newspaper) and requested and has received take-out food and drink.\"\nHickox said she's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else.\n\"The tent has a window, and doctors talk to me in normal clothes from outside the window,\" she says. \"So if there's no risk to them talking to me from outside the window, it doesn't make any sense that my lawyer wouldn't be able to do the same.\"\nA spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make Hickox comfortable.\n\"While we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience, it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible. We have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient,\" said Stacie Newton, spokesperson for University Hospital in Newark.\nWould policy discourage health workers?\nHickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to West Africa to help quell the Ebola outbreak.\nThat thought was echoed by Dr. Rick Sacra, an Ebola survivor.\nHe said he's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored\n\"You might have some renegade workers flying into Toronto and then driving home and so they're not on anyone's radar,\" he said. \"If quarantines push people away from transparent, friendly, respectful, dialogue with public health workers, that may increase the risk back home.\"\nHickox said she would welcome Christie to visit her in the hospital.\n\"Maybe he could tell me what 'obviously ill' means. That would be great,\" she said.\nShe added that she doesn't regret her trip to help Ebola patients in Africa.\n\"Someone asked me earlier would I do this again if I knew what would happen, and my answer is categorically yes,\" she said. \"I feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work.\"\nAfter hearing Hickox's phone interview with Candy Crowley on Sunday, New Jersey Health officials emailed CNN's \"State of the Union\" to refute some of the claims made by Hickox.\nIn the email, Donna Leusner, communications director for the New Jersey Department of Health, wrote that Hickox did receive reading materials and got computer access.\nLeusner also wrote that \"the patient was given a copy of the quarantine order on Friday and is receiving regular updated information.\"",

The selling was broad based. JetBlue (JBLU)and Southwest (LUV) were down even though neither company has a big presence overseas.\n\nOf the U.S. airlines, United Continental (UAL) probably has the most exposure to Africa through its Star Alliance, according to Joe DeNardi, an airlines stock analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, but United's shares weren't any worse off than their large rivals American (AAL) and Delta (DAL).\n\nAmerican Airlines does have a large hub in Dallas, where the infected Ebola patient was identified, but the stock wasn't down any more than others. \"I think it's a general concern that people are going to start traveling less if this gets worse,\" DeNardi said. \"There's no discrimination between international and domestic.\"\n\nDeNardi noted that up until this point, airlines were largely spared from concerns about Ebola. But now, he says Wall Street is wagering that if the virus spreads further in the United States, people's travel decisions are going to change. To be sure, airlines have had quite the run this year thanks to an improving economy, higher fares, and overall consolidation in the industry.

            "Text": "Yes, Ebola is a scary infectious disease. But the first thing you should know is that it's not very contagious -- \"Common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare, if it happens at all,\" the World Health Organization says. It's spread through frequent contact with bodily fluids and can be spread only by someone who is showing symptoms.\nSo if they're not feeling sick ...\nMany viruses can hide in the body and spread from person to person without causing any symptoms in the people it infects. Ebola isn't like that.\n\"Ebola doesn't spread before someone gets sick,\" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday. \"Ebola does not spread ... from someone who doesn't have fever and other symptoms.\"\nSymptoms generally occur abruptly eight to 10 days after infection, though that period can range from two to 21 days. As people with the Ebola virus become sicker, they become more infectious, experts say. The virus can also spread through bodily fluids after the patient dies.\nAnd by 'bodily fluids,' you mean?\nBlood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen and spit. Basically any kind of fluid that comes from the body. People in West Africa are avoiding hugs and handshakes because the virus can be spread through the sweat on someone's hand.\nThe uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin of their hand that would allow entry of the virus, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. But \"we all have minor breaks in our skin. And there is a possibility that some of the virus can be transmitted that way.\"\nHealth care providers -- or family and friends -- caring for Ebola patients are often at the highest risk of getting sick because they are most likely to come in contact with the body fluids of sick patients, according to the CDC. People with Ebola suffer from extreme vomiting, diarrhea and high fevers, which causes sweating. In the later stages, they may start bleeding from their eyes, mouth or other orifices.\nEbola virus: Nine things to know about the killer disease\nBottom line?\n\"This is not an airborne transmission,\" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. \"There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood.\"\nClose contact\nWhile the Ebola virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, Doctors Without Borders says, agents such as chlorine, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. While the CDC acknowledges it is possible for a person infected with Ebola in West Africa to get on a plane and arrive in another country -- which is apparently what happened in the U.S. case -- the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low. That's unless your fellow passenger is bleeding, sweating profusely or vomiting on you, of course.\n\"It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,\" the International Air Transport Association said.\nTravelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoiding contact with Ebola patients.",

            "HeadLine": "8 dangerous HIV myths debunked by the experts",
            "Text": "HIV/AIDS is one of the highest profile diseases of our times, but many of us are still ignorant about key aspects of the illness, how it works and how to live with it.\n\nHIV has killed an estimated 39 million people to date, but making it more dangerous are the misunderstandings and stigmas that surround it. We asked experts to debunk some of the most prevalent and damaging myths about HIV. This is what they said. It can take many years for symptoms of HIV to show up, which means you could be carrying the disease for a long time without experiencing any warning signs.\n\"In the average adult it takes between eight to 10 years for someone who is HIV positive to show signs that they're infected and ill, so it's almost impossible for people to tell if someone has HIV early on,\" says Owen Ryan, executive director of the International AIDS Society.\nThis means it's extremely important to be checked for the virus if you are sexually active. And of course, using a condom correctly every time you have sex can greatly reduce the chance of becoming infected. The WHO recommends that people who are newly infected start treatment early on to protect their immune system. The treatment involves antiretroviral therapy (ART), which means taking drugs every day to suppress the virus in your body.\n\"There is a dramatic impact on a person's health and well-being throughout their life if they start HIV treatment immediately,\" explains Ryan.\n\"And it's not just for them, it's for their families and partners as well. People who are on HIV treatment who are responding well to treatment, they are 96% less likely to pass on HIV to their partners.\" Just because we have made huge leaps in battling HIV over the past few decades, it doesn't mean we should become complacent, argues Ryan.\n\"I think the biggest myth is that HIV is no longer a problem,\" he says. \"What I find a lot in my job is that a lot of people think that HIV is a problem of 10 years ago.\n\"I don't think people know that there were 1.2 million deaths to AIDS in 2014. If more people knew that they'd be shocked. Six hundred children a day are infected with HIV; that's just an outrageous statistic.\n\"I think we've moved into a period of apathy which we really have to push against. So the big myth that HIV is over is far from true.\" If a pregnant woman is HIV positive the baby will not necessarily become infected. Even without treatment the chance of the baby acquiring the disease is about 25-33%, according to professor Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Center for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA).\nBut this risk can be significantly reduced with PrEP (Pre Exposure Prophylaxis), which involves giving antiretroviral drugs to HIV negative people that are at risk of becoming infected.\n\"We can provide antiretroviral drugs to protect and prevent mother to child transmission, such that the transmission rate is now below 1%,\" Karim explains.\nAside from PrEP, it's also possible to wash sperm for artificial insemination. HIV is carried in the fluid around the sperm (rather than by the sperm itself) which means it can be removed before the female partner is inseminated. But while this may be a highly safe method, it's not without its costs.\n\"It's not done very often these days,\" says Karim. \"It's not a cheap process because it involves many steps and it also involves artificial insemination, which is quite expensive.\"\nSperm washing can greatly reduce the risk of infection, but does not guarantee it. HIV can be transmitted through blood, which means you could get infected by shared needles, or tattoo and piercing tools that haven't been sterilized properly between uses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that tools that cut the skin should be used once, then thrown away or sterilized.\n\"For places where tattoos or piercings are unregulated, or where they're happening in settings that are open to infections, then of course there's going to be a risk there,\" says Ryan.\n\"It comes down to a basic rule. Anywhere where you're sharing something that has come into contact with blood and hasn't been cleaned, you are at risk of HIV infection.\"\nMyth: HIV is a death sentence.\nThere is no cure for HIV. There is also no vaccine for the disease. However, the quality of drugs has developed significantly over time.\nPeople can now reduce their viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) to undetectable levels using ART. This means that the infection stops progressing as quickly, protecting the immune system from the disease.\n\"Most patients, well over 95%, even up to 99% of patients on therapy should have little difficulty in leading a normal life, and carry no concern about mortality provided they take their treatment properly,\" says Karim.\nMyth: HIV is the same as AIDS.\nHIV is the virus that leads to AIDS. But, with the right treatment, HIV positive people can live their entire lives without getting AIDS, which is the final stage of the disease when the body's immune system is severely damaged. As Myron Cohen, the director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina explains, having HIV is very different from having AIDS. \"The detection of the virus has almost very little to do with AIDS as long as the replication of HIV is stopped. So HIV does not (always) and should not ever evolve to AIDS.\n\"In the early days before we knew HIV was the cause of this infection, and before we had treatment, the hospital was filled with people who had AIDS. Now, in our thousand plus bed hospital it's weird if we have anyone with AIDS admitted, it's a rare admission.\n\"We would prefer never to see AIDS again. HIV is the cause of AIDS but it doesn't need ever to evolve to AIDS.\"\nMyth: If you are diagnosed with HIV you won't live as long as everyone else.\nThis myth stems from the idea that being diagnosed with HIV is a death sentence. However, with new developments in treatment technology, that needn't be the case.\nAs Cohen explains, taking treatment early on, and taking it properly, \"Leads to robust health, no signs or symptoms for the most part, and an entirely normal lifespan.\"\nTreatment for HIV has improved dramatically over the years, and according to Cohen a variety of new treatments are being tested and could be used in the near future.\n\"In 1985 there was nothing. In 1995 there was one pill. In 2005 we had gone from one pill to three pills that were now combined into one pill a day.\n\"In 2015 we're looking at two injectable agents in combination that last for maybe up to 8-12 weeks. So you'd only need four shots a year under some circumstances ... But these are experiments. Its good news that we're trying, but everything's an experiment.\"\nCohen adds: \"The goal is the end of AIDS. I've been doing this for about 35 years; I started my own personal career when we became aware of HIV, and I continue to work and I can see the end game. That's the same for many other investigators, that's not just me. We're seeing the beginning of the end.\"",

            "Text": "In many ways, this is the most hopeful World AIDS Day we have seen in the 35-year history of the scourge that we know as HIV/AIDS. Yet, it is also one of the most challenging, in terms of the work we still have to do to translate scientific progress into more saved lives, fewer new infections and ultimately an end to the AIDS pandemic.\n\nLack of tools and information to end the pandemic is no longer the challenge; we have a clear path forward. The question is whether -- and when -- we will accomplish this goal. We now have definitive proof that starting anti-viral treatment for HIV as early as possible following initial infection not only preserves the health of those living with HIV but also protects their uninfected sexual partners by dramatically reducing the likelihood of transmitting HIV. In addition, we now have solid evidence from numerous clinical trials showing that the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, a highly effective form of HIV prevention that involves taking a single anti-HIV pill each day, significantly reduces an individual's risk of contracting HIV. The World Health Organization recently responded to these developments by recommending that every HIV-infected person immediately begin treatment and strongly supporting the use of PrEP for individuals at high risk of HIV infection. Yet while the scientific progress that has been made to date deserves celebration, we must avoid the temptation to prematurely declare victory against HIV. History has shown that progress in certain global health initiatives, paradoxically, can lead to complacency and diversion of attention to other areas. As a result, we may fail to invest the attention and resources needed to finish the task.\nIndeed, the reality is that this epidemic is far from over.\nAccording to newly released numbers from UNAIDS, 1.2 million people with HIV died and another 2 million became newly infected with HIV in 2014. And so, this World AIDS Day, rather than hitting the brakes, we must accelerate our efforts.\nSeveral critical steps need to be taken:\nFirst, the global community of nations must strengthen its commitment to funding the best and most promising research on HIV. While recent advances in HIV prevention and treatment have been extraordinary, there are still formidable scientific challenges that remain, including an HIV vaccine and a cure. These goals cannot be accomplished without a strong commitment to sustained high level of support for HIV research.\nSecond, the United States needs to continue its long-standing global leadership in expanding access to essential HIV treatment and prevention. The United States PEPFAR program and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria play critical roles in this effort and support for these programs must continue. Thanks to the work of these and other national and international efforts, nearly 16 million people now have access to HIV therapy.\nSeveral years ago, this striking achievement would have been unimaginable; however, it still represents less than half of the 37 million people worldwide who need treatment today.\nPEPFAR and the Global Fund will also play a central role in the years ahead to expand access to PrEP in developing countries. The renewed United States commitment to supporting the extraordinary work of these organizations must be echoed by other wealthy nations and by the governments of countries with the greatest HIV burdens that stand to benefit the most from domestic and international support.\nThird, it is equally important to address laws and policies that discourage or prevent people in need from accessing HIV services. We must speak out against a disturbing trend in many countries toward laws that criminalize HIV transmission and further stigmatize and discriminate against people at risk for HIV.\nMore than 75 countries -- including many heavily affected by HIV -- criminalize lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and as a result directly enable the epidemic.\nLaws that permit discrimination against people living with HIV in housing and employment encourage the ignorance that allows HIV to flourish. And punitive and discriminatory policies drive other people at risk for HIV, including sex workers and people who inject drugs, away from critical HIV prevention, treatment and care services -- even in places where those services are available. Ending the epidemic means ending the discriminatory attitudes that fuel these counterproductive laws.\nFifteen years ago, when the International AIDS Conference was held in Durban, South Africa, very few people on the continent had access to HIV therapy and few believed it would even be possible to deliver HIV treatment in resource-limited settings. That conference was a milestone in the history of HIV because it prompted a call to action to urgently bring treatment to developing countries -- and the world listened.\nIn 2016, the conference will return to South Africa, which is now home to the largest HIV treatment program in the world. Much like its 2000 predecessor, the 2016 conference comes at another pivotal moment in the HIV epidemic and will provide a global platform to raise awareness about the work that remains to be done to make the end of AIDS a reality.\nHIV is one of the deadliest diseases humankind has ever faced, claiming 40 million lives so far. But as formidable as HIV remains, we have come too far to allow progress towards its termination to stall.\nWe believe that, with the right combination of global resolve, political commitment and financial resources, the world can begin to write the last chapter in the long struggle against HIV.",

Improving living standards mean many Chinese are living and remaining sexually active for longer.\nBut now the threat of HIV/AIDS looms large over a segment of Chinese society not previously known for a high prevalence of cases: senior citizens.\nWhat is HIV/AIDS?\nAmong new HIV-positive cases nationwide, those over the age of 50 accounted for almost 15% at the end of 2009 -- a sharp rise from less than 8% just four years earlier, according to a recent report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The center said most patients were male and contracted the virus through unprotected sex.\nThe United Nations has estimated 780,000 people will be living with the AIDS virus in China by the end of this year and more than half of them are unaware of their condition. Chinese officials acknowledge the real figure may be higher, particularly among the elderly.\nWest must not give up on AIDS fight\n\"It's very hard for us to obtain an exact number due to our limited ability to monitor and report the epidemic situation in this age group,\" Hao Yang, deputy director of the Health Ministry's disease control bureau, told a health seminar in Beijing last year.\n\"Older people are more prone to having medical conditions that require surgeries and hospitals are stricter on pre-operative checks -- that's how many of them are notified of their HIV status for the first time.\"\nResearchers say the lure of easy sex with prostitutes -- the average price paid a relatively modest $5.5 -- and the lack of safe sex knowledge among their generation have exposed an increasing number of Chinese senior citizens to the danger of HIV/AIDS.\nAnother 30 years of AIDS?\nHao said his ministry had already started including the elderly in its HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention campaigns, which previously targeted only younger people and high-risk groups like migrant laborers and sex workers.\nBut many activists view the government effort as inadequate in dealing with a burgeoning problem, especially as senior citizens diagnosed with the AIDS virus tend to face far greater difficulties and discrimination in China than their younger counterparts.\n\"Traditionally the elderly are the respected members of family and society, but once infected with HIV, they become a disgrace and face harsh moral judgments,\" said Zhang Biao, whose non-governmental organization AIDS Care in China has counseled elderly patients in southwestern China for five years.\n\"People of their age are usually pillars of their households, taking care of both their parents and children,\" he added. \"But instead, these patients now have to rely on their families to support them financially and psychologically.\"\nOthers echo Zhang's sentiment, adding that elderly patients remain neglected in state-sponsored AIDS treatment and prevention programs.\n\"Currently AIDS patients are required to provide proof of residence and employment to receive basic care at public hospitals,\" said Yu Tian, a volunteer with Shanghai-based NGO Leyi.\n\"But many elderly patients are either unemployed or unable to work due to their medical conditions -- making them ineligible for subsidized antiviral treatment.\"\nActivists have called on the government to overhaul its HIV/ AIDS policy and allow NGOs to receive more international funding and cooperation.\n\"We are willing to work with other experts to reach out to the elderly and teach them the concept of safe sex,\" said Yu. \"There's so much room for improvement in this area.\"",

            "Text": "Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery. And then I was startled that he backed down and delayed the rally by a day.\nI will let others examine Trump's cruelty in stoking racial divisiveness at such a historical flashpoint. Let others comment on his flippant disregard of public health experts as he ridicules mask wearers as unmanly of PC for caring about keeping themselves and others safe from Covid-19.\nInstead, I will focus on the remarkable idiocy of staging a large indoor public gathering in Tulsa just now.\nTulsa may not be the single worst place in the US to have a mask-free and liability-free rally, though the just identified Whirlpool plant outbreak there may place it in the running. Indeed, cases are going up sharply in Tulsa County (from 7-day rolling average of 13.6 cases to 53.37 cases for most recent two weeks) signaling substantial community transmission. The disease appears disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics who constitute 13% of the population but 27% of the Covid-19 cases.\nFurthermore, Tulsa is near the border of several states; Trump's rally is likely to draw from these areas as well. Over in Arkansas, four counties at the Oklahoma border -- Benton, Washington (home of Fayetteville), Crawford, and Sebastian (home of Fort Smith) -- have experienced sharply increasing case rates in the last two weeks.\nThis is likely due to the concentration of meatpacking plants in the area, Nationally, these areas have been connected to Covid-19 transmission due to the tight quarters in processing lines and other areas in busy plants. Tyson Foods, the second largest meatpacking company in the US, is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, which straddles Benton and Washington Counties. It is a mere 100 miles from Tulsa.\nTulsa also is a few hours down the road from the southwest corner of Missouri. Jasper (home of Joplin), McDonald and Newton Counties each have gone from almost no cases two weeks ago to more than five cases daily per county -- in Jasper's case, nearly 10 (again, rolling 7-day average). This has led local authorities to reinstitute some precautions. The source of the increase is not known, though adjacent Barry County features a chicken meatpacking plant that has seen its first two cases. As we have witnessed repeatedly, today's two cases may presage tomorrow's frantic headline.\nSo, from a strict public health perspective, the selection of Tulsa is a terrible decision. So why the choice? Yes, Tulsa is an extremely conservative city with wonderful cheeseburgers and a deluxe golf course, as well as a city where he has found enthusiastic support at past rallies, but this is true of many cities in the South. Is the choice really just another manifestation of Brutalist politics?\nAs a native Oklahoman, I have a theory: Oral Roberts. Oral Roberts and the hazy world of faith healing. I know this topic quite well. As a kid, on Sunday mornings, my brothers and I used to watch Oral Roberts on television. Our Hebrew Sunday School started at 10 a.m., so we killed time in the early hours watching the faith healing shows till it was time to go listen to the rabbi.\nImportantly, this was before Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and the other preachers with high production values crowded out the field. The Oral Roberts shows then were grainy and uncertain with a jittery camera and fluctuating sound that made them strangely sincere.\nWatching, my brothers and I felt confusion and awe, wondering if they were kidding or if they were actors or if they were insane or if they maybe were being cured -- I mean it seemed so convincing in its own way. Rows of people looking up, believing and eager and happy despite (or because of) the scene's basic lack of credibility. They shrieked and clapped as Oral Roberts' touch and prayer healed person after person. Which brings us to now and the Trump rallies. For me, the most unsettling feature as he gloats and preens his hour upon the stage is the hypnotic connection between him and his crowd. Because these are the very faces I saw on my Sunday morning TV -- those of people who are witnessing an incredible miracle.\nTulsa therefore is the perfect place for the President to resume his campaign. Not only does he get a groveling crowd and a chance to cruelly wink at the city's racist past but because he is guaranteed something he can't find any place else: an arena full of people raised on the exhilarating lunacy of a giant tent revival.",

Following Bolsonaro's call, members of a Brazilian family upset by the death of a hospitalized relative also stormed the ICU unit of a Rio de Janeiro hospital used to treat Covid-19 patients on Friday June 12.\nDr. Alexandre Telles, president of a local doctors' union and a physician at the Ronaldo Gazolla Hospital, told CNN that the area that the deceased patient's relatives entered was a restricted one: \"According to the reports I got from medical staff that saw the scene, the family was very angry for losing their relative and because her death certificate came as suspected of Covid-19.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been tied to serious cardiac events as well as other side effects among Covid-19 patients.\n\"Accordingly, FDA revokes the EUA for emergency use of HCQ and CQ to treat COVID-19,\" Hinton wrote in the letter, using abbreviations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. \"As of the date of this letter, the oral formulations of HCQ and CQ are no longer authorized by FDA to treat COVID-19.\"\nDoctors can continue to legally prescribe the drugs off-label, as they can with any drug that's approved for other conditions. The FDA's emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was narrow in scope, applying only to hospitalized Covid-19 patients and only to drugs donated to the Strategic National Stockpile.\nThe FDA on Monday also warned against giving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to patients who are also getting remdesivir, the one drug that has any authorization for use in treating coronavirus.\nMixing remdesivir, an infused antiviral drug made by Gilead Sciences Inc., and either controversial drug could reduce the effectiveness of remdesivir, the FDA warned.\n\"The agency is not aware of instances of this reduced activity occurring in the clinical setting but is continuing to evaluate all data related to remdesivir,\" the FDA said.\nIn an open letter published late last month, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn appeared to defend the agency's decision to issue the authorization.\nLISTEN: The Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction Podcast\n\"This decision was based on evaluation of the EUA criteria and the scientific evidence available at that time. We continue to look at the data on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and we will make future determinations on these products based on available evidence including ongoing clinical studies,\" Hahn said in the letter last month.\nThe emergency use authorization, or EUA, made it easier for pills donated to the national stockpile to be distributed to coronavirus patients.\nHahn added in the letter that \"we also knew it was important to help ensure a stable supply of the drugs for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis given the increased demand.\"\nIn an interview with CNN last month, Hahn also defended his agency's handling of hydroxychloroquine. He acknowledged the political climate surrounding the drug, but said, \"I stand by our decisions because I think they are rooted in science and data, and we'll continue to reevaluate.\"\nThe World Health Organization said on Monday that it is still reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in its Solidarity Trial, a multi-country clinical study of Covid-19 treatment options. The organization had temporarily paused the trial in May due to concerns surrounding the drug's safety and in order to review its own data, but resumed the program earlier this month.\nTrump has been a frequent cheerleader for a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin as a Covid-19 treatment. He promoted the drugs dozens of times, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not, and has said he took hydroxychloroquine to prevent being infected with coronavirus.\nDespite the warnings from health experts, retail sales of the decades-old drug soared in recent weeks amid the growing public attention on the medication.\nThis story has been updated to include additional background information.",

            "Text": "Dr. Halfdan Mahler, director general of the World Health Organization, predicted today that \u201cnext year the world will have seen, its last case of smallpox.\u201d\n\nDr. Mahler, a Dane, said that that expected successful conclusion in 1975 of the organization's worldwide smallpox eradication campaign would by itself justify the cost of the agency to its, member states since its foundation 25 years ago.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he announced that Indonesia, once a major smallpox area, had been declared free of the disease by an international committee.\n\nThe last smallpox case reported in Indonesia was in January, 1972.\n\nWhile preventive vaccination against smallpox on a mass basis will have to be continued as a safety measure in countries such as India and Bangladesh, where it is endemic, this will no longer be necessary in the developed countries, Dr. Mahler said. The savings will be tremendous for these countries, according to the health official. He said that routine vaccinations for smallpox and the complications that sometimes resulted were estimated to cost $150\u2010million annually in the United States alone, or more than the $115\u2010million budget for 1975 that the 138 W.H.O. member states are expected to approve next month at their annual assembly.\n\nDr. Mahler said that he predicted \u201cwithout the slightest hesitation\u201d the end of smallpox in 1975 despite the upsurge in cases last year, when the 132,399 cases recorded were more than double the total a year earlier. He said that his confidence was based on the way countries like India and Bangladesh had mobilized their resources for the final drive on the disease.\n\nWith South America also freed of smallpox, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Ethiopia remain the only countries where the disease is endemic. The number of endmic countries was 30 at the start of the campaign in 1967. The campaign is supervised by Dr. Donald A. Henderson, an American, on loan to W.H.O. from the United States Public Health Service.\n\nLast Case in U.S.\n\nThe last confirmed case of smallpox in the United States occurred 25 years ago in Texas. It resulted from a case acquired outside this country. Policies toward smallpox vaccinations in the United States are slowly changing. Some states require a smallpox vaccination for admission to elementary schools. But Public Health Service officials in recent years have favored stopping routine vaccination of American children, unless they are at high risk of acquiring the infection.\n\nTheir stated reasons include a declining probability of smallpox importation, reduced likelihood of spreading following importation and occasional untoward side effects of vaccination.",

            "Text": "The worst form of smallpox, the kind that kills, blinds and maims, has been eradicated but a much milder form remains in Somalia on the horn of Africa, Dr. Halfdan Mahler, the head of the World Health Organization, said here today.\n\nThe last case of the most virulent form of smallpox, called variola major, occurred in Bangladesh in October 1975 in a 3-year-old girl, Rahima Banu. She survived her attack of the viral infection.\n\nFor the last two years, 12,000 Bangladesh health workers, aided by 100 W.H.O. and international staff workers, have made repeated house \u2014 to \u2014 house searches for additional, hidden cases. None were found.\n\nAnd tomorrow a nine\u2010member international commission of physicians will formally declare smallpox eradicated from Bangladesh. \u201cWe have signed the death certificate of smallpox in Asia,\u201d Dr. Mahler said. That act leaves just the milder form in the horn of Africa.\n\n\u2018A Day of Victory\u2019\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it, this is day of victory,\u201d Dr. Mahler said from Dacca, Bangladesh, to reporters here. \u201cIt is here, on these densely populated plains, so often ravaged by flood, famine and war, that smallpox had its most ancient and tenacious roots.\u201d Victory was accomplished by applying modern management and technological methods to the discovery of smallpox vaccination, which was made in the 18th century the English physician, Edward Jenner. The Geneva\u2010based World Health Organization began its drive to eradicate smallpox from the world 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cTo do within that remarkably short time what had not been done in more than a century is nothing short of public health miracle,\u201d Dr\u2022 Mahler said. The health organization has still not achieved total victory over smallpox because the African horn is still considered infected. More than 3,200 cases occurred in Somalia this year, but there have been none in the last seven weeks, Dr. Mahler said.\n\nDr. Donald A. Henderson, who formerly directed the smallpox program from Geneva and is now dean of the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: \u201cIf anyone put up $1 million and asked to be shown a case of smallpox now, we would not be able to accept the $1 million.\u201d Too Early to Know\n\nBut Dr. Henderson and Dr. Mahler stressed that it was too early to know if the last case had been detected in the horn of Africa. Flooding and conditions in the war\u2010affected area have added to the difficulties of searching for smallpox cases there now.\n\nAfter the last case is detected, African health workers will spend two more years searching the area, as was done in Bangladesh and the dozens of other countries from which the disease was eradicated in the last decade, before an international commission declares the infection eradicated from the world.\n\nDr. Mahler said that before eradication of all forms of smallpox was declared the organization would require documentation from all member states, including those like China where the health organization did not conduct a program to eradicate smallpox.\n\n\u201cFrom all the signals we have, I have not the slightest doubt that we will be able to satisfy the most inquisitive kind of tribunal of scientists and public health administrators,\u201d he said.\n\nHuge Saving Foreseen\n\nDr. Henderson said that when total eradication was attained, there would be no need for smallpox vaccinations for anyone. That will save the world $2 billion each year, he added.\n\nThe United States and 15 other countries have already stopped routine vaccinations, and others are expected to follow- shortly. Most smallpox vaccinations given to Americans now are given only to those who plan to travel.\n\nAlthough World Health Organization member countries passed a resolution stating that requirements for smallpox vaccination certificates should be limited to people coming from countries where smallpox existed, such documents have been demanded of many people traveling between areas not affected by smallpox. Dr. Henderson said that, according to international health regulations, the absence: of smallpox cases in Somalia for the last seven weeks meant that \u201cno country should request a smallpox vaccination certificate of any traveler coming from anyplace in the world.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is \u2010the way it should be, but the. weeks of bureaucracy move slowly, and it will take a little time for all travelers to travel freely without any worry, about\u201d smallpox \u2022 vaccination certificates.\n\nAid to Family Planning Seen\n\nDr. Mahler said that people in developing countries that have been freed from smallpox would gain confidence that their children would survive and that the quality of their lives would improve. As result, he said, parents would be more accepting of family planning programs.\n\nDr. Henderson said that with the virulent form of smallpox now eradicated, the causative virus, variola major, was probably extinct in nature. It exists in test tubes in a few laboratories where scientists are tightening security to prevent accidental infections such as occurred in England a few years ago.",

            "Text": "DACCA, Bangladesh, Sept. 23 \u2014Smallpox is about to be eradicated from the earth.\n\nOfficials of the World Health Organization expect the battle against the disease to end early next year, if not sooner, and they expect two years of further searching, after the last case is cured, before an international commission will be able to declare officially that smallpox has been wiped out.\n\nThe World Health Organization says It knows of just 16 people in the world infected with the most devastating kind of smallpox, which is a viral disease. All 16 are quarantined here in Bangladesh while forces of epidemiologists go sloshing through mud and ride shallowbottom boats through monsoon floodwaters to visit isolated villages in search of undetected cases.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the only other country where smallpox is endemic, another force of W.H.O. epidemiologists is vaccinating people in the highlands where about 100 are infected with a milder form of smallpox.\n\nThese two teams of epidemiologists are fighting what the specialized United Nations agency believes will be the last battles of a global war that began in Berkeley, England, 179 years ago when Dr. Edward Jenner scratched the arm of 8\u2010year\u2010old James Phipps with a vaccine prepared from germs taken from a woman infected with cowpox. Through history, the variola virus that causes smallpox has killed one out of four victims of the disease, has blinded millions and scarred them for life with hundreds of deep pits on their faces and bodies. Smallpox is one of the most deadly, most feared and most contagious diseases.\n\nTotal eradication would be one of the greatest triumphs of public\u2010health work. Experts say it would mark the first time that man had made a disease extinct. Dr. D. A. Henderson, an American who heads the W.H.O. smallpox eradication program from Geneva, said in a recent interview in New Delhi that he expects this event to come in Ethiopia later this year or early next year, depending on the extent of civil strife in the East African country.\n\nWith victory in the smallpox war apparently in sight, Bangladesh and the organization have armed 20,000 Bengali and international health troops with two\u2010pronged needles for vaccination as their chief weapons. These forces rely on every possible means of transportation to search for smallpox among the 80 million people of this country, where acceptance of the infection as one of life's inevitable hazards is traditional.\n\nBattalions of health forces wade through the rice paddies and tea plantations in Sylhet, in the north, check ships and seamen in the port of Chittagong, in the southeast, cruise aboard steamers along a series of inland rivers to Khulna, in the southwest, and search large markets and resettlement camps for beggars and unemployed people outside Dacca, Mud and Shaky Bridges\n\nOthers in the war on smallpox ride four\u2010wheel\u2010drive vehicles through mud; still others walk for miles in the monsoon rains, over the bamboo\u2010pole bridges that are the only links between patches of dry land. On occasion the bamboo spans break. Dr. Stanley O. Foster, an American epidemiologist laughs when he recalls two occasions when he was drenched after a bridge collapsed under him.\n\nAt cemeteries, some troops check each body for undetected smallpox. Others ride the taps of trains to vaccinate hordes of beggars. Conductors collect tickets from only about 25 per cent of the passengers on trains here, which often carry as many people on the roofs as there are inside the cars.\n\nSailors pole shallow\u2010bottom boats through the rice paddies; sometimes they cruise in inland waterways in speedboats, whose outboard motors often stall when thick vegetation in the floodwaters fouls the propellers.\n\nThere is an air force in the smallpox war, a small squadron that flies Russian\u2010built helicopters to areas inaccessible by other means of travel.\n\nCoup Had No Effect\n\nThe progress of this vast army was not affected by the jockeying for political power that followed the bloody coup of Aug. 11 in which Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the first President of Bangladesh, was killed.\n\nA victory atmosphere was apparent this week when a group of American, Austrian, British, Egyptian, French and Polish epidemiologists came to Dacca from their field posts. They spoke excitedly of their mission as they dined at the W.H.O. guesthouse on curried mutton.\n\nEradication of the ancient scourge would not only offer humanitarian rewards but would also save the world's governments the $1\u2010billion that, is spent every year to guard noninfected countries against smallpox. Virologists say victory is possible because smallpox is one of the few infections that spread directly from human to human without an indirect stage in an animal or insect like the mosquito that transmits malaria. Neither is it a disease spread by food or water, like cholera.\n\nSome diseases, like poliomyelitis, diphtheria and tetanus, have been reduced to minimal incidences in the United States and other developed countries. Such infections can be effectively controlled by immunization. But ecology prevents their eradication, because the causative germs remain in the environment, ready to strike the unprotected. Accordingly, pediatricians recommend that each new generation of babies be immunized against these infectious diseases.\n\nEven those developed countries that have eradicated malaria, yellow fever and other infections risk new epidemics when cases are imported from infected areas elsewhere. Smallpox is viewed differently. By breaking the human\u2010to\u2010human chain of smallpox spread, scientists maintain, the disease will die out once the last scab leaves the skin of the last patient.\n\nConcern Over Missed Cases\n\nAt the W.H.O. guesthouse, the epidemiologists were anxious: Had they missed any cases?\n\nA search in a village selected at random had uncovered a new case. More important, the responsible team of Bengali health workers had not done its job properly.\n\nUntil the last smallpox patient dies or recovers, a new epidemic could start in any uninfected country at any time as a result of exposure to an unreported case from either Bangladesh or Ethiopia. That new outbreak, in turn, could cause epidemics elsewhere.\n\nHow many more overlooked cases were there? An epidemiologist, who had been riding a heat every day for several weeks to search isolated villages, said, \u201cIt's time someone with a fresh view took over for a while. He may see something I'm overlooking.\u201d \u201cIndia hasn't had a smallpox case since May\u2014a miracle,\u201d an Austrian said. He grinned. \u201cJust 16 cases here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can't let up now. We need luck.\u201d\n\nThe epidemiologists have established a pool on the date when their program reaches its gold of \u201csmallpox zero\u201d ?? Bangladesh. Many are bet??ing on middle\u2010to\u2010late October.\n\n\u2018Real Test\u2019 Is Ahead\n\nThe spread of smallpox usually dwindles in monsoon season and flares in the drier winter. The variola virus dies more quickly in humid weather, and survives longer in dry weather.\n\nSeveral epidemiologists nodded when a British doctor said: \u201cThe real test will be next February. If there aren't any cases then, we've won. If there are cases, then we're in serious trouble.\u201d\n\nIn the field, the health troops search schools, homes, villages and other areas for rashes and fevers that might represent unsuspected smallpox. They make lists of individuals who were exposed to smallpox victims when those victims were capable of spreading the virus \u2014indirectly, through respiratory droplets in the air, like a cold, or through direct physical contact with the scabs.\n\nThe troops then track down the potential victims by telegraphing or broadcasting to allied forces elsewhere in the country or world. They offer rewards of $20 \u2014 about a month's salary for a well\u2010paid Bengali\u2014to the health official and the member of the community who report a new case.\n\nSpecial Team Testing All\n\n\u201cIf there is just a 1 per cent chance that a rash might be smallpox we err on the side of quarantining the person vaccinating everyone within a one\u2010mile area and intensifying a search for other cases within a five\u2010mile radius,\u201d a Bengali smallpox epidemiologist said. To minimize the chances of missing a case and allowing the disease to smolder, W.H.O. has hired a team of Japanese virologists. The smallpox rash characteristically is thickest on the face, arms, palms, legs and soles, but relatively sparse over the trunk. The pattern is the reverse of chicken pox, with which smallpox can be confused. Because smallpox can manifest itself in an uncharacteristic pattern, the Japanese virologists are testing specimens from every suspect case.\n\nIf Bengalis who are risking smallpox decline vaccination, doctors go to their homes to convince them of the benefits of vaccination. One doctor recalled such a visit: \u201cI am Dr. T. Stephen Jones from the World Health Organization and I have come to warn you that you are in danger of getting smallpox. One of your neighbors is sick with smallpox. You should be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe Bengali replied that he had been vaccinated when he went to Britain several years ago.\n\n\u201cYou need another vaccine because it may not still protect you,\u201d Dr. Jones replied. The Bengali extended his arm for the needle.\n\nA Wound of Rattle\n\nDr. Jones's argument has not always been accepted so readily. His scalp bears the long scar of a severe cut suffered last year when he tried to vaccinate a group of skeptical Indians at night during an epidemic in Bhojpur, Bihar state. One Indian struck Dr. Jones over the head with a cane: he thought Dr. Jones might be a robber. Then, as blood flowed from Dr. Jones's scalp, the Indian relented and agreed to be vaccinated.\n\nThe troops communicate with one another over an elaborate radio network, to exchange information and to mobilize health forces when a new outbreak strikes. Jane Brown, the communications officer, begins each day at 7:30 with a standard greeting to each battalion, in a crisp British accent: \u201cThis is Smallpox Zero. This is Smallpox Zero. Flow do you co??\u201d\n\nThe other morning troops in Bhola reported two new outbreaks. In one, the first two victims were the smallpox \u201cw??tch doctor\u201d and his wife Twenty Bengali and W.H.O, ??demiologists joined in ?? antine\u2010and\u2010search work.\n\nCash Reduced to 16\n\nUsing such tactics, the Bangladesh health forces have reduced the total number of ac tive smallpox cases to just 16, from a peak of 1,850 reported five months ago. Those in the program's leadership express more concern about hidden outbreaks, cases the troops have not detected or that health officials suppress. Bengali health officials often falsify statistics so that a situation will look better on paper than it really is. Some health officers fear\u2014falsely\u2014that they will be punished for reporting a smallpox case. Officials say the reverse is true. When Bangladesh health officials learned that reporting of the Bhola outbreaks was suppressed for almost a month, they punished the health workers responsible.\n\nHealth officials are wary of overconfidence. Twice in the last five years, smallpox was virtually wiped out in this country. But the precipitous drop of recent months has encouraged cautious predictions that the spread will stop in the next few weeks.\n\nAbdul Mannan, the country's Minister of Health, said in an interview in his office: \u201cWe are cautious because, in the past, when we had no smallpox cases in our country, smallpox occurred again. We use statistics provided by W.H.O. as our official statistics, and we hope we can bid goodby to this dreadful disease later this year.\n\n\u201cEven then, we must maintain vigilance, for another two years before W.H.O. declares smallpox eradicated from Bangladesh.\u201d\n\nBengalis Joining In\n\nThe smallpox war forces are enlisting Bengalis who will travel from the cities to their villages to celebrate holidays next month at the end of Ramadan. The Bengalis are being asked to search their villages for smallpox, to investigate persons who had had rashes, and any living person with a rash. Bangladesh officials believe that the risk of spreading the disease during the mass migration is small\u2014none of the cities involved are known to be currently infected with smallpox.\n\nSince Dr. Jenner's historic vaccination, doctors fought smallpox with guerrilla\u2010warfare tactics. Then, in 1967, W.H.O. acted on a mandate from the nations of the world to wage a global war to eradicate smallpox by 1976. This war is expected to cost the United Nations agency $250 \u2010 million, over a decade. The Geneva\u2010based organization has mobilized 2,000 epidemiologists from at least 50 countries, and hundreds of thousands of health workers in smallpox\u2010infected countries.\n\nWhen the World Health Assembly issued the mandate in 1966, many doctors were skeptical. But the program had strong believers in the Government of the Soviet Union, which has donated large supplies of vaccine to infected countries, and in the United States Government, which has lent the international campaign many epidemiologists from the Public Health Service's Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. The Gains Since '45\n\nSkepticism remains, but there are fewer skeptics now, with the number of persons actively infected with smallpox in the world reduced to 125 known cases. In 1945, most of the countries of the world were infected; just seven years ago thousands died of smallpox in 32 countries. Smallpox has not re\u2010emerged in those countries where it has been wiped out in recent years.\n\nEpidemiologists have been killed and wounded in the fight against the scourge. Other doctors have been evacuated by air because of hepatitis, severe dysentery and the myriad medical problems that affect people in the tropics.\n\nDr. Foster, the American epidemiologist, looks back on setbacks that have cost him sleep and premature thinning and graying of his hair. \u201cWe were very close to eradicating smallpox and then we got into serious trouble with the widespread floods and famine last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we drop the ball in the next two months not only the Bangladesh program but the world program could be finished.\u201d",

            "Text": "We take off our watches, bracelets, rings and other personal possessions, and my host, Dr. James Nakano, locks them away. We walk clown a hall from his cluttered office to an unmarked wooden door. He unlocks it.\n\nInside is a tiny dressing room equipped with a toilet, sink, hooks on the wall and several lockers. We strip naked and don green surgical pants and pullover tops and put on disposable green surgical caps, taking care to cover ears and hair.\n\nWe step barefoot through the shower (without using it) and go through an unlocked door to an air lock outside the laboratory. It is all slightly unnerving, claustrophobic.\n\nYet there is no disputing the necessity for these precautions. Tragic events in England last summer leave no doubt about how dangerous to mankind smallpox research can be. Last Sept. I, Dr. Henry Bedson, 49, a renowned microbiologist and smallpox authority at Birmingham University in England, entered the potting shed outside his home and cut his throat. His wife, Ann. was talking on the phone and she watched from a window as her husband disappeared into the shed. The couple had been about to do some gardening. When she went in search of him a few minutes later, she found him in pool of blood on the potting\u2010shed floor. An ambulance rushed him to a hospital, but he died five days later.\n\nDr. Bedson's suicide and my presence in the smallpox laboratory at the Federal Government's Center for Disease Control (C.D.C.) in Atlanta were related because of the two other events that preceded the scientist's death:\n\nIn August 1977. a team of World Health Organization (W.H.O.) scientists working in Merka. Somalia, diagnosed a case of smallpox in a cook William Stockton is a regular contributor to this Magazine. named Ali Maaow Maalin. He was isolated, and the 161 people who had been in recent contact with him were searched out and vaccinated. Health teams then fanned out in search of the contacts of Ali's contacts, examining every case of chicken pox and skin rash they could find. No more smallpox was discovered, and by mid\u20101978 W.H.O. officials were declaring that mankind probably had seen its last case of smallpox. The ancient scourge that had killed millions since the dawn of civilization would soon be officially eradicated.\n\nBut just a year later, a medical photographer at Birmingham University \u2014 Janet Parker, 40. who worked one floor above Henry Bedson's lab became ill. Thinking she had influenza. she stayed home from work, but a rash appeared and her symptoms worsened. She entered a Birmingham hospital on the afternoon of Aug. 24, and doctors. working far into the night, reached the astonishing diagnosis: She had contracted smallpox \u2014 the disease that was thought no longer to exist.\n\nJanet Parker was hurriedly moved to a special isolation hospital. She died of smallpox on Sept. 11. Three days later, her mother, Hilda Whitcomb, 70, was diagnosed as having smallpox; she, too, was placed in isolation, and eventually recovered. Another \u2018300 people were quarantined and vaccinated before the emergency was declared over. Dr. l3edson's laboratory was studying smallpox virus. The virus escaped, probably through a leaky inspection port on a duct carrying cables and wiring. Janet Parker worked irt a room directly above another leaky port in the duct. The laboratory was subsequently found to have been shockingly mismanaged. Only luck prevented a major outbreak in Birmingham of a particularly virulent strain of smallpox. \u201cI am sorry to have misplaced the trust which so many of my friends and colleagues placed in my work \u2026,\u201d Dr. Bedson said in a note he left. \u201cI realize this act is the least sensible I have done, but may, I hope in the end, allow [my family) to get some peace.\u201d\n\nThese events cast in sharp relief a difficult problem that science and mankind never has had to face before: If an ancient, deadly and historically feared disease is at last eradicated through the marvels of modern medicine, should the laboratory stocks of the virus that caused it be kept for important related research? Nine laboratories, three in the United States, are known to have retained smallpox virus. What steps are being taken so that none will escape again in the distant future, as it did in Birmingham. conceivably causing major epidemic in a population that by then may have lost its immunity, population treated by doctors who may have all but forgotten the disease? And how reliable are these precautions?\n\nThe air lock outside the smallpox laboratory at the Atlanta center which is the only place in the United States where the smallpox virus is being studied \u2014 is bathed with ultraviolet light until we enter. The light is shut off automatically by the opening of the door from the shower so that we won't be exposed to the radiation. We step to a cabinet \u2014 also lighted ultravioletly and select pairs of old tennis shoes for our bare feet. My shoes have no laces and flop.\n\nSeveral weeks before my tour. I had been vaccinated against smallpox. The day I arrived at the center, a member of the public\u2010information staff escorted me along a covered catwalk joining the main building with the laboratories handling dangerous materials. On the steel door to Dr. Nakano's floor was yellow warning forbidding entry to anyone who has not received a smallpox immunization within three years. I was told by various people at the lab that the sign is commonly ignored. Surprisingly, the door to the smallpox floor was unlocked_ and the hall leading into the building was deserted. No guard challenged us. No bell rang. Our pasindonesian Mani whose virus was analyzed in the campaign to wipe out smallpox. sage wasn't monitored on closed\u2010circuit television. No one was aware of our entry until we turned a corner at the end of the hall and stepped into Dr. Nakano's windowless office, where he and I talked for about an hour before we headed for the lab.\n\nI am reassured by the lock on the dressing\u2010room door. (The British inquiry had found that Dr. Bedson's lab often was unlocked, often even unattended.)\n\n\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Dr. Nakano says, inspecting my outfit and moving toward the smallpox\u2010laboratory door. \u201cO.K., here we go.\u201d he says. stepping in.\n\nThe research at the Atlanta lab had its beginnings in 1796 when an English country physician named Edward Jenner found that if a person was deliberately infected with cowpox, which caused only a mild illness, he would be immune from smallpox. Although the practice of vaccinating people with cowpox spread quickly to other countries, smallpox maintained its hold on most of the world until the 20th century. Even after immunization against it became widespread in the industrialized nations, the majority of third\u2010world nations continued to suffer from it, at least until 1967, when an intensified international campaign was launched. Most infectious diseases, even if they are wiped out, will return again because the responsible agent - usually a virus - can live naturally in some animal and emerge to reinfect humans. But smallpox has no known animal host. If the last smallpox viral particle can be killed in the last case of human smallpox, then the virus is gone forever, most scientists believe, although there are several \u201cmaybes\u201d attached to this possibility_\n\nBy 1977, smallpox remained only in the Horn of Africa, among parts of Ethiopia. Somalia and Kenya. Finally, only the nomadic tribes of the region were infected and now, with the treatment of Ali Maaow Maalin and his contacts and with the containment of the virus in Birmingham, smallpox does indeed seem vanquished. The World Health Organization won't officially declare it so for a year, however, to make certain it finds nothing more. To encourage reporting, a $1,000 bounty is offered to any person who brings in a smallpox case. Yet most smallpox experts believe that stocks of smallpox virus should be saved, and they base their argument on the possibility that the disease might somehow recur or some new form develop. There are several ways this might happen. none of which experts believe are likely. One involves the chance that viral particles might be lying dormant in someone who once had smallpox and survived. Other viruses are known to act in this way. But as yet there has never been a known smallpox case in a smallpox\u2010free country, such as the United States, whose source couldn't be accounted for. The source has always been traced either to a traveler from an infected area or to a laboratory where an accident occurred. No outbreak has ever been attributed to the virus spontaneously arising in someone who had the disease before.\n\nThe most worrisome, remote, possibility is that animal pox - diseases that are characterized by viral skin eruption and frequently other deeper complications - might somehow be altered through natural or man\u2010made events and become smallpox. There are a number of known animal poxes - monkeypox, racoonpox, cowpox and so on. Monkeypox causes the most concern because three dozen humans are known to have caught monkeypox from handling monkeys. There is no evidence that those people passed the disease on to another human. Worrisome, too, is whitepox. a little\u2010understood form of skin eruption in animals. No case of whitepox in humans is known, but since the whitepox virus can't be distinguished from smallpox virus, a case might go undetected. No one is willing to rule out the possibility that whitepox could be a close relative of smallpox, waiting for something to trigger its appearance\n\nFears about monkeypox and whitepox are the most persuasive reasons why smallpox virus stores in laboratories should be kept. The handful of scientists around the world who work with smallpox have ambitious plans to study it and the animal txixes further. They are seeking definitive answers about whether the animal diseases could affect humans, perhaps even becoming infectious from human to human and, in effect, replacing smallpox. They contend they need smallpox virus to carry out the experiments.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Bedson's laboratory in Birmingham was working on such problems. A method had been developed to differentiate one virus from another by analyzing the proteins found in the coat of each virus particle. The work has been halted now, of course, and the laboratory closed.\n\nDr. Michael Lane, who is the head of the Center for Disease Control's smallpox eradication unit and is not involved in smallpox\u2010virus research, is a lonely scientific voice advocating the eventual destruction of virus stores. \u201cThere's no question that for the next two or three years we should keep the virus as we complete the search for any remaining smallpox cases in the world.\u201d he says. \u201cBut very shortly after we reach that point, think the virus should be destroyed. I'm not sure I see the theoretical benefits of keeping this little lump of genetic material available forever.\u201d Smallpox vaccine is made not from smallpox virus, but from a harmless relative, vaccinia virus. Smallpox virus won't be needed if vaccine manufacture must be resumed someday. Dr. Lane contends that vaccinia virus is sufficient within the laboratory to diagnose the presence of smallpox, if a suspected case should ever arise. Stores of the animal\u2010pox viruses would not be destroyed, so they would be available to test whether a suspicious case had an animal origin. Dr. Lane, who argues that laboratory workers could du without smallpox virus itself and not have their future work greatly affected, insists that \u201cwe need a lot more open scientific debate on the question.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization hopes to reduce the number of laboratories holding smallpox virus to just four by 1980. As of last month, there were eight, in addition to Atlanta's: the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md.; the American Type Culture Collection, Starkville, Md.; the Research Institute for Viral Preparations, Moscow; St. Mary's Hospital Medical, London; Institut (Ur Schiffs\u2010und\u2010Tropenkrankheiten, Hamburg; Rijks Instituut voor de Volksgezondheid, the Netherlands; the National Institute of Virology, South Africa, and the Institue for the Control of Drugs and Biological Products, Peking.\n\nThe Atlanta center, St. Mary's Hospital in London and the Russian laboratory are three likely permanent sites. Until December, the Chinese were an unknown quantity. But when the Global Commission for the Eradication of Smallpox met in Geneva, China sent a brief report, saying simply that the virus exists in one laboratory in Peking. Nothing is as yet known about the safety or sophistication with which the smallpox virus is handled, or about plans to save or destroy the virus. There has been speculation that, during the Cultural Revolution in the 60's, some smallpox samples may have become lost in freezers of various laboratories as scientists and technicians were swept up by the Red Guards.\n\nLost or hidden vials remain a worldwide concern. The accurate reporting of laboratories \u201chas to be on a good\u2010faith basis,\u201d says Dr. Donald A. Henderson, former head of the W. H. 0. eradication program in Geneva and now dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \u201cThere is no way that we can go through every deep freeze in the world and look at each vial.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the Atlanta center recently sought to persuade the Defense Department and the American Type Culture Collection, a private scientific group, to transfer all the virus there. Neither group is at present conducting smallpox experiments; both were reluctant at first to comply, but have now agreed. The Defense Departnient was as.sured that it could go to Atlanta and perform experiments if necessary And the\n\nAt the Atlanta Center for Disease Control. Dr. James Nakano points to equipment used for sterilization. Rockville, Md., scientists were assured that they would be consulted before any decision was made to destroy smallpox stores.\n\nIt probably will be summer, or later, before the virus is consolidated within one institution. The Atlanta center plans to keep a backup supply in a storage unit being built several miles away in case a storage freezer fails, for example, and destroys the primary specimens. However, the bulk of the nation's store of the virulent virus will be retained in Dr. Nakano's laboratory. As I stand in the lab itself, my feeling of claustrophobia intensifies. It is a room about the size of a large living room, with a smaller room to the side. The humming overhead is from the air\u2010filtration system. Work tables and shelves line the walls. Beside the door are two large padlocked freezers that contain smallpox samples. And at the other end of the room are biological safety cabinets, where the smallpox is examined and worked with through the use of large builtin rubber gloves; a worker inserts his or her hands into the gloves to manipulate equipment inside.\n\nI peer around, looking for some of the safety shortcomings that Dr. Nakano has frankly acknowledged exist. He has told me that, after a smallpox laboratory accident in Great Britain in 1966, he \u201cdecided to set up the safest laboratory possible. I knew that if anything ever happened with smallpox in the United States, everyone would point the finger at the C.D.C. So toured the labs in Europe to see how they were doing it. and then tried to make this lab even better. We used 1966 standards. The standards have become more rigid since then and we've done our best to keep up.\u201d\n\nDr. Nakano has shown me a set of World Health Organization recommendations. Conforming with these, the lab has negative air pressure inside so that, if any cracks in walls and openings aren't sealed, air will not leak out but instead will be drawn in; the outside air lock through which we entered and will leave; showers for use each time anyone leaves; special air filters to take out contaminated material from air circulating through the closed \u201cglove box\u201d cabinets; its own sterilizing equipment ; a system for decontaminating lavatory effluent.\n\n\u201cBut there are some weak points,\u201d Dr. Nakano says. Air drawn into the room is not filtered, for example, so a failure of the air\u2010circulation system could cause a backflow, sweeping contaminated air backward through the ducts and out of the lab. Difficulties have been encountered in sealing cracks in the walls, ceilings and floors.\n\nDr. Nakano is quick to point out, however, that authorization has been received to build a new Si million smallpox lab in another part of the building, Incorporating all the safety and technology improvements made available since 1966. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nAt the safety cabinets, Dr. Nakano shows me how air drawn in from the room passes through them and then through high\u2010density filters to take out any contamination before being discharged from the lab. The cabinets are filled with a mist of a sterilizing substance to kill any remaining smallpox virus once an experiment is finished.\n\nWe inspect the room's two sinks. The one closest to the work area has its drain plugged. Liquids poured into it are collected in a bucket underneath. The contents are sterilized and then poured down the other sink, which connects to the sewer. \u201cHere's an example of where we have a potential human\u2010factor problem, where someone could make a mistake.\u201d Dr. Nakano says, pointing at the second sink. \u201cEveryone is trained never to pour anything down this sink unless it has been treated first. But someone could forget. Our new lab will take care of this particular problem.\u201d\n\nOnly one person, Denise Brown, is working in the lab, as is often the case. She sits at one of the work tables, dressed as we are, preparing material for study under an electron microscope in another part of the building. \u201cIt takes a special kind of person to work in here alone with all these safety procedures and the like day after day and not make a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\nThe technician laughs. \u201cThat's for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I like it in here by myself. You get a lot more work done. Not all that yakking with everybody all day long.\u201d\n\nShe usually takes a morning break and a lunch break. Each time she leaves the lab, she must leave her surgical clothes on the laboratory side of the shower, take a complete shower with soap, and change into street clothes.\n\n\u201cEven with all this containment we have to have people trained to come in here every day, do their work and leave without ever causing a problem,\u201d Dr. Nakano says.\n\n\u201cYou sure do,\u201d she echoes.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many little details,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you take the shower you must always be sure to blow your nose thoroughly. You may have breathed in something in the air and it has lodged in your nose. Then, outside, you sneeze and contaminate something. Isn't that right?\u201d he asks, smiling.\n\nShe makes a face.\n\nOne wall of the laboratory has a large window looking out into the hall through which visitors pass just after entering the building. Dr. Nakano sees me looking at it. \u201cYou need the window so you can see into the laboratory when someone is working alone, in case there is an accident,\u201d he explains. But someone could always break into the lab by smashing the window, he adds. It is as time to go. We say goodbye to Denise Brown and step back into the air lock.\n\nUntil 10 or 15 years ago, many scientists working with dangerous viruses and bacteria had a cavalier attitude about the risks. A prevailing belief in some laboratories was that workers should be exposed to the agent under study so they would catch it and become immune, obvious exceptions being the highly dangerous organisms that produce frequently fatal diseases.\n\nSmallpox in the lab was often treated casually. In Britain years ago, one famous smallpox scientist kept live smallpox material in an envelope on a shelf in his office. It was routine to conduct experiments on open benches with no protective equipment. And only last month, the shocking findings of a British Government panel that investigated the Bedson affair were leaked to the press. The inquiry found that Dr. Bedson's laboratory's containment procedures were woefully inadequate, marked by carelessness and failure to follow prescribed procedures; that since 1975, when he was appointed head of Birmingham University's microbiology department, he had spent little time in the laboratory, turning its operation over to a research fellow who had never been formally trained in containment procedures; that the laboratory's workload had increased as much as tenfold in complete research before the lab was to be closed at the end of 1978; that he was less than frank about some of his laboratory's procedures and even lied to safety inspectors about some operations. He was a member of various official groups that were supposed to oversee his facility's safety, but the groups had found nothing wrong in his lab.\n\nIt is difficult to measure just how frequently laboratory infections occur throughout the world. Unusual infections are reported in the scientific literature, but many others considered \u201croutine\u201d are not. In a study completed in 1975, Dr. Robert M. Pike at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas tried assessing the number of known worldwide laboratory infections. He identified 3,900 (2,500 in the United States) that caused at least 164 deaths among laboratory workers in the past several decades since the advent of modern scientific research. The study identified 18 infections involving smallpox; 10 of the victims in the United States died. Dr. Pike found that 18 percent of the infections were caused by known accidents, which means that, in 82 percent of the infections, the route of exposure to the infectious agent remained\n\nIn 10 cases the infection was the result of an apparent suicide attempt. In seven cases someone tried deliberately to harm another person. Two persons were infected for experimental reasons, a procedure which would not now be permitted in view of changing medical ethics. Dr. Pike also reported a case in Japan in 1966 of a disturbed bacteriologist's deliberately spreading typhoid organisms in food, causing 44 cases of typhoid fever.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control has developed a reputation as one of tne most careful of the world's laboratories that study dangerous organisms. It has handled all the most deadly infectious agents known to mankind and has never had a fatality. But early in 1977 the laboratory was badly shaken when two workers contracted Rocky Mountain spotted fever and died. One man was a warehouseman, the other was involved with collecting waste material and sterilizing glassware. Neither was studying the disease. Clearly, Rocky Mountain spotted fever had escaped the rooms where it was being studied. A breakdown in safety procedures almost certainly was responsible.\n\nShocked C.D.C. officials launched a massive investigation not only of how the Rocky Mountain spotted fever had escaped, but also of the center's overall safety procedures. The final report, published at the end of 1977, is hard\u2010hitting, surprisingly so since it represents a Government institution investigating itself.\n\nThe report's authors found deficient safety practices to be widespread at the institution. Buildings housing laboratories that study dangerous organisms were often \u201cinherently unsafe for much of the work being performed in them.\u201d Biological safety cabinets often malfunctioned. As an economy measure, fans that forced air through the cabinets were turned off each day at 4:30 P.M., causing a backflow which could sweep contaminated air into the rooms and halls of a building if some worker was still performing an experiment. Many laboratories working with highly infectious agents did not have their own sterilizing equipment for glassware. This meant that contaminated glassware was carried through halls and stacked in racks \u2014 sometimes near elevators \u2014 to await sterilization in central autoclaves. Packages containing Class 4 infectious agents\u2014the most dangerous \u2014 had been unpacked in a main laboratory before being taken into the maximum containment laboratory. A \u201cdisturbingly high frequency\u201d of unreported laboratory\u2010acquired infections was found. The safety study revealed that 124 infections were acquired by center employees through 1976, in either laboratory or field work. None of these involved smallpox. Despite the shortcomings revealed by the study, the center is generally regarded as being as safe as any laboratory in the world and safer than most. \u201cMany of our facilities were built almost 20 years ago when some of the organisms we study now hadn't even been discovered,\u201d says Dr. John Richardson, the head of the Federal institution's biosafety office. \u201cSafety procedures evolve with time. New equipment and new procedures are developed and we become more sensitive to the added need for safety. The important thing is to make certain we continue learning and stay alert.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked about the ease with which I had entered the building where the smallpox laboratory is located, Dr. Richardson said that the center plans to install special locks on all that building's exterior doors. The locks will open only with coded magnetic cards. He said they should be in place by mid1979.\n\n0\n\nBack in the air lock, Dr. Nakano and 1 step out of our shoes, onto the cold tile floor, and place them in the sterilizing cabinet. He remains in the air lock while I enter the shower room. Nothing that has been on the laboratory or \u201cdirty\u201d side of the shower must pass through to the clean side except a thoroughly scrubbed and naked body.\n\nSo I strip off the surgical garb and place it on a rack beneath an ultraviolet lamp and get in the shower. I soap myself thoroughly, but do not wash my hair because it has been covered. shout at Dr. Nakano that I am finished and step into the \u201cclean\u201d dressing room. He follows me into the shower. Back in his office, I retrieve my valuables and sign a logbook where the name and address of every visitor in the lab is recorded. \u201cIf I begin to feel ill in a couple of weeks, I'll give you a call,\u201d I say jokingly.\n\n\u201cCall me immediately,\u201d he replies without a smile.\n\nWalking along the catwalk and then down the halls of the main building, am struck by two things. The first is that, although the center prides itself on an open atmosphere \u2014 employees aren't required to wear badges; visitors can roam all the halls unquestioned \u2014 I find myself hoping that, if bureaucratic problems are slowing installation of the magnetic card locks on those exterior doors, the problems are quickly solved.\n\nThe second thing I think about is that Dr. Lane is, at least in part, right. Because people are people, regardless of how safe laboratories handling smallpox become, human error almost certainly will release smallpox virus into the environment sooner or later. In the \u201cworst case\u201d situation, as many scientists generally perceive it, several thousand people might contract the disease before urgent efforts to vaccinate and surround the outbreak could take effect. And despite all that medicine has to offer, there is no cure for smallpox, which has a fatality rate of about 25 percent in its most virulent form, called variola major, the variety that killed Janet Parker.\n\nI have found the atmosphere in the laboratory is oppressive. The attention to detail, the complicated entrance and exit procedures and the solitude when one is locked in do require a special personality. And there is always the chance that repetition eventually will breed indifference, even contempt. Smallpox virus, like radiation, is something you can't see. Nothing reminds you each time you enter or leave the room that you are dealing with a dangerous organism. Mental alertness is the only answer.",

            "Text": "An Indian Government report of an epidemic of 75,000 smallpox cases, including at least 10,000 deaths, in the northeastern state of Bihar has renewed interest in the hazards of the spread of communicable diseases around the world. When news breaks about an epidemic anywhere, inevitably concern arises about changing travel plans to avoid the infected area. But, according to officials of the World Health Organization in Geneva, whose responsibility it is to help stop epidemics before they become global plagues, if a traveler is properly vaccinated, he should not let the smallpox epidemic him from visiting India.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nConcern over the effect of epidemics on tourism and commerce is one of the reasons that countries have traditionally been reluctant to publish facts about communicable diseases.\n\nSituation Changing\n\nHowever, the situation has begun to change. The World Health Organization has increased its emphasis on the surveillance of communicable diseases, It has adopted a tougher line on member nations that suppress reports about the presence of certain diseases.\n\nIn 1970, officials of the agency took unprecedented action by declaring Guinea infected with cholera when officials of that West African country denied its presence. And the organization has taken a greater role in educating the public about health hazards by issuing pamphlets advising travelers about the areas where malaria is considered a health threat. Nevertheless, the editors of The Lancet, an internationally respected medical journal published in London, took W.H.O. to task last month, charging that it was \u201closing ground\u201d by not being sufficiently aggressive in its war on disease.\n\nJets Bring Action\n\nThe introduction of jet travel has spurred the World Health Organization into action. A jet flight is faster than the incubation period of virtually every infectious disease, whether caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites or other infectious agents. With the jet, these diseases, which are the leading killers and health hazards in most countries, can be exported literally overnight.\n\nAs the American Public Health Association has warned:\n\n\u201cModern jet travel, eliminating geographic barriers, has produced the paradoxical situation where any disease may be seen anywhere on the globe, and the patient probably will visit a physician who has never before, seen this disease.\u201d\n\nNo clearer example exists than Lassa Fever.

Fuller in \u201cFever!\u201d (Reader's Digest Press $8.95) vividly relates how Lassa Fever, a lethal viral disease, struck down American missionaries in Africa and was imported into the United States where laboratory workers and doctors caring for patients fell victim to fevers as high as 106 degrees. A Global Attack\n\nLassa Fever is a dramatic example of how any attack on a communicable disease must be a global one. It is this philosophy that is behind the World Health Organization's program to eradicate smallpox.\n\nThe stakes in the program are considered enormous. Smallpox afflicts only humans. Theoretically, once the last case is effectively treated, no further spread could exist because the disease is not known to occur in animals.\n\nIf the program is successful and if the theory is proved, health officials say it would mark the first time that man had succeeded in a deliberate effort to wipe out a disease.\n\nWith this goal in mind, W.H.O. is focusing on the four countries where smallpox is now endemic\u2014India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Epidemiologists are seeking. out every case, tracing all known contacts and vaccinating the population of the infected area.\n\nUnder such circumstances, figures on, cases and deaths are more likely to reflect the true incidence of smallpox rather than the tiny portion reflected in the usual voluntary reporting system. Accordingly, Dr. Donald A. Henderson, who heads the smallpox program in Geneva, said in an interview that he expected the totals reported daily to W.H.O. by the Indian Government to rise before they fall.\n\nThe eradication program makes smallpox an unusual example of how conuaunicable diseases are customarily reported.\n\nOrdinarily, the process starts in the doctor's office. Reports of such diseases as smallpox are obligatory while those for other infections like, tetanus are voluntary. These reports, which are made to local health departments throughout the world, are sent on to the World Health Organization by governments. The accuracy of the reporting system partly reflects the degree of sophistication of the local medical and public health practices. Statisticians who pore over these health reports are trained to pick up slight changes that might signal an epidemic. The resulting administrative practices depend on the locality because the definition of an epidemic varies with the setting.\n\nAmerican public health officials would define as an epidemic a single case of a disease long absent from a population \u2014such as a case of smallpox anywhere in the United States. On the, other hand, it sakes thousands of deaths in India to call attention to the worsening of a chronic, endemic health hazard.\n\nBut with the campaign to spread mass vaccinations in India, W.H.O. officials foresee the day when there, too, one case of smallpox will be defined as an epidemic.",

            "Text": "SHORTLY after I became an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta in 1963, one of my bosses, Dr. Donald A. Henderson, startled me at lunch when he said that smallpox, an incurable, potentially fatal viral disease, could be eradicated if only new public health management methods were combined with traditional vaccinations.\n\nHere was a fascinating, challenging idea about an epidemic infection that had altered the course of history. It had killed millions and had scarred and blinded many more. Medical schools emphasized treatment of disease, not prevention. No professor even hinted at the concept of eradication. Only a rare teacher emphasized the individual physician's limitations and how much more could be accomplished by international teamwork.\n\nInfectious disease was my field of interest. Yet my knowledge of smallpox was strictly from textbooks. Although smallpox existed elsewhere in the world, the last case in this country occurred in Hidalgo County, Tex., in 1949.\n\nAlthough Dr. Henderson did not originate the idea of eradicating smallpox, it added an entirely new dimension to my thinking. Still, not for a moment that day did I dream of joining tens of thousands of others in a war that would wipe out a disease for the first time in history. However, in 1964 Dr. Henderson sent me to Africa to help run an immunization program sponsored by the Agency for International Development against another viral disease, measles. Although his instructions were to learn as much as possible about smallpox, we did not know then that the mission would play a key role in the World Health Organization's program to eradicate smallpox. \n\nOn Oct. 26, the World Health Organization is expected to declare the disease eradicated from the Horn of Africa. There, in Somalia, the chain of human\u2010to\u2010human spread of smallpox was broken two years ago. (Two cases occurred in England in 1978, but those infections were acquired in a laboratory where researchers were experimenting with the virus.) For the two years after the last case in each infected country, teams of health workers have searched for hidden smallpox cases. After the evidence is evaluated by an international commission this winter, official certification of the eradication of smallpox is expected to be made next May at the World Health Organization's annual assembly.\n\nAt a W.H.O. meeting 20 years ago, a Russian proposal to eradicate smallpox met with little support, particularly from this country and leaders of the health organization. Efforts to eradicate yellow fever and malaria had failed, and there was reluctance to try a third time.\n\nThe vaccine now used to protect against measles was tested in Upper Volta in western Africa before licensing in this country. For unknown reasons, the disease is more devastating there than here, and success in field tests led several west African countries to request immunization of their populations against measles. The United States Government, whose policy then was to demonstrate American presence in newly independent countries, supported a measles, not smallpox, eradication program in western Africa. That program encountered grave difficulties. Because of the lack of scientific planning, the goal of eradicating measles from the area could not be met. The problem was compounded by logistical errors.\n\nHundreds of vials of gamma globulin, a costly human blood product, were sent by mistake because someone misread globoline iodine tablets. The gamma globulin was deemed unsafe because it had been sent unrefrigerated, and had to be discarded.\n\nGiant trucks designed for American highways proved too heavy for the wooden planks that served as bridges in Africa. The vehicles could not withstand the ruts in the African bush roads and fell apart after a few miles. The refrigerators that A.I.D. built into the trucks to keep the measles vaccine viable worked only in temperatures below 90 degrees.\n\nPleas to Washington officials for instructions on how to make the refrigerators work resulted in these cabled instructions: park the trucks in the shade to lower the ambient temperature below 90 degrees. It was the Sahara. Failing to see anything taller than a bush, I demanded an emergency airfreight shipment of 10,000 Dutch elm trees. A diplomat relayed the message out of channels lest otherwise a forest be sent by jet.\n\nWe got the refrigerator to work in one truck, but the delight vanished when the vehicle exploded just after I climbed out. The reason: the gasoline tank was built next to the butane gas flame that fueled the refrigerator. Had the other refrigerators worked, the entire fleet, not to speak of staff, could have been lost.\n\nThe measles program was anything but a success and my feeling, shared by other colleagues, was that A.I.D. hindered more than helped international health. Nevertheless, the fiasco led the Center for Disease Control to capitalize on the mistakes and press for a smallpox program. In a series of steps, A.I.D. reluctantly shifted its emphasis from measles to smallpox.\n\nIn turn, the World Health Organization recognized the success of the American smallpox eradication campaign in western Africa and developed a global program that Dr. Henderson headed in Geneva. I was in Bangladesh and India in 1975 when smallpox was wiped out of Asia and experienced again the problems inherent in such a program: I was trapped without provisions on a roof in Patna, India, for six days and nights during a flash flood.\n\nAlthough medicine is dramatic, the medical profession lacks the kind of theatrical flair demonstrated by athletes and entertainers. Babe Ruth once pointed to the bleachers and then whacked the ball there for a home run. Health workers probably had not done anything like that before W.H.O. declared it would eradicate smallpox within 10 years.\n\nPublic health workers justifiably stress their dedication to improving human well\u2010being. However, smallpox eradication was undertaken as much for economic as altruistic reasons. In this era of cost\u2010benefit analysis, justification for wiping out smallpox comes from the savings of $1 billion that will be realized each year from reducing quarantine services, eliminating vaccinations and the treatment of smallpox cases and complications of vaccination. Without such savings, the governments of the world probably would not have overcome complacency to undertake the venture.\n\nHowever, it was the epidemiologists\u2019 ability to adapt new methods as they gained new knowledge about the ancient disease, and the human spirit that overcame bureaucratic obstacles that were crucial to the success of the eradication program.\n\nDoctors learned that smallpox was less contagious than previously believed. Also, they learned that quarantining all cases and vaccinating everyone who had contact with such individuals was more effective in breaking the chain of spread than the traditional technique of mass vaccination. Further, they learned the importance of public participation. They gave cash rewards \u2014 a most unusual step for medicine \u2014 to people who reported cases of the disease.\n\nTechnology played its role. Development of a potent freeze\u2010dried vaccine that did not need refrigeration and that could be reconstituted easily made it possible to vaccinate in the most remote areas of the world. Use of a twopronged needle that held precisely one dose of vaccine cut costs drastically and allowed amateurs drafted for the program to immunize reliably.\n\nPeople have said that if W.H.O. did nothing but eradicate smallpox, the organization would have justified its existence. But the program has done more. It has boosted interest in the global aspects of medicine by pointing up how relatively simple measures could help suppress many infections in the third world that the developed countries controlled long ago. Eradication of smallpox has stimulated experts to debate what they had not previously considered possible \u2014 better control, if not eradication, of other infections such as measles, yaws and common childhood diseases.\n\nAnd it has stimulated many researchers who had confined themselves to the ivory tower approach toward tropical diseases to become interested in applying their skills to seek better treatments of the diseases that are everyday problems in developing",

            "Text": "NEW DELHI, July 15\u2014India's smallpox epidemic has spread from Bihar and the number of cases has reached more than 130,000.\n\nAlthough health officials maintain that the epidemic is ebbing, they are worried that the virus disease will persist here and in neighboring Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The four nations and Ethiopia account for all reported cases.\n\n\u201cIt's a vast country with lot of movement,\u201d Karan Singh, the Health Minister, said of India in an interview. \u201cPeople from Bihar travel to different states. We have reports of smallpox in other states, in Uttar Pradesh, in West Bengal, mainly the result of people from Bihar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the worst is over\u2014famous last words, I hope,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn't mean the epidemic is over.\u201d Dr. Donald A. Henderson, United States Public Health Service officer who heads the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication program, gave the following figures for cases in India: Bihar 91,400, Uttar Pradesh 28,000, West Bengal 9,000 and Assam 4,000.\n\nHe said that the fatality rate was about 20 per cent, indicating that 26,000 had died.\n\nHe added that Calcutta had reported about 25 cases each week since the start of the year and that New Delhi had about 120 cases. \u201cIf this interest and concern about ending smallpox can be maintained for the next few months, it's all over,\u201d Dr. Henderson said in an interview. \u201cWe don't think we're overconfident, but everything looks good. By June of 1975 we hope we'll be finished with smallpox in Asia.\n\nThe Indian authorities have been troubled by the epidemiclargely because of widespread allegations, at home and overseas, that impoverished and caste\u2010ridden Bihar had neglected the problem. The state of 60\u2010million, with a reputation for corruption and political instability, has seen student agitation in recent months.\n\nSpeedier Action Urged\n\nIt is known that Mr. Singh, the Health Minister, has written at least twice to Bihar's Chief Minister, Abdul Gaffoor, urging speedier action. \u201cThe Administration of the anti\u2010smallpox campaign has not been satisfactory,\u201d Mr. Singh asserted. Last week The Times of India, terming the epidemic in Bihar a scandal, said, \u201cThe failure to come to grips with the challenge has been largely the result of the callousness of the bureaucracy and the political leadership.\u201d\n\nThe health authorities say the epidemic is waning because of a mass immunization campaign by W.H.O. and the Government as well as a natural decline during the summer. Smallpox, whose viral particles are spread through the respiratory tract, often leaves its victims blinded and scarred.\n\n\u201cWe can't do anything about a smallpox case \u2014 there's no treatment,\u201d Dr. Henderson said. \u201cThe important thing is to know who is infected, and how do we stop it from spreading.\u201d\u2019\n\nThree Weeks of Watching\n\nThe smallpox teams isolate villages where cases appear, vaccinate everyone and then remain for at least three weeks to vaccinate visitors. If no new cases appear within three weeks, the teams are satisfied.\n\nMr. Singh, who is scheduled to visit Bihar this week, said that thousands of nurses, vaccinators and teachers were in the state,\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the primary immunization \u2014 the first one after birth\u2014has often not been given, although the idea was that every child should have one,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow we're reaping the whirlwind, so to speak.\u201d\n\nNot only is preventive action especially difficult because of the mobility of the populace; in addition millions live in squalor in cramped quarters where disease spreads rapidly. Anotherl, factor is the widely held belief among peasants that smallpox is the wrath of a much\u2010feared goddess who punishes with the disease and that vaccination will only incur additional wrath.\n\nAccording to the latest figures, Bangladesh has had 13,000 cases this year, while Pakistan has reported 7,000. Nepal 1,000 and Ethiopia, the only afflicted nation outside the Asian subcontinent, 3,000.",

            "Text": "A scientist, the World Health Organization and British health officials have been severely criticized in a report by a British Government committee for not acting to correct procedural lapses that led to the escape of potentially lethal smallpox virus from a university laboratory in England.\n\nMedical investigators said that breaches in techniques, use of facilities and administrative practices led last summer to two British cases of the disease, one fatal.\n\nJanet Parker, a 40\u2010year\u2010old photographer who worked in an anatomy laboratory near the smallpox laboratory at the University of Birmingham, died in September. The investigators, citing her case as one breach in question, said that she had not been vaccinated since 1966. Mrs. Parker infected her 70\u2010year\u2010old mother, Hilda Whitcomb, who recovered.\n\nThe World Health Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, and British officials \u201cfailed to appreciate the extent of the hazard,\u201d according to a medical investigation recently ordered by the British Government. A copy of the report was made available to The New York Times last week. The report by the British committee comes at a time when the world is thought to be free of smallpox, and at a time of intense international debate over the wisdom of keeping the variola, or smallpox, in selected laboratories in several countries for research purposes. The World Health Organization, an advisory body with no enforcement power, is convening a group of experts in Geneva Feb. 27 and 28 to decide whether there is justification for retaining stocks of virus after certification of the eradication of smallpox, expected later this year.\n\nThe Birmingham accident points up the dangers posed by keeping stocks of smallpox virus without arrangements for maximum security. Nine laboratories are known to hold stocks of smallpox virus, but only those at the Federal Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and St. Mary's Hospital in London meet the W.H.O. safety recommendations. Under prodding by the agency, a military laboratory and a private laboratory, both in Maryland, are expected to turn over their viruses to the Atlanta center. In the last 13 years, epidemiologists have traced three outbreaks of smallpox to viruses that escaped from university laboratories in England. Two resulted from lapses in technique at the University of Birmingham laboratory, and the first patients in each case were photographers working in the same studio in the anatomy department.\n\nOne infected person can easily spread the virus and start an epidemic anywhere. The British committee, headed by Prof. R. A. Shooter, concluded that Mrs. Parker was infected either when the virus escaped through the air or was transferred to her by accidental contact with a visitor to the laboratory. \u201cOnly chance and the efficient control measures of the preventive safety authorities prevented a wider spread of infection,\u201d the committee's report said. The Birmingham laboratory was headed by Dr. Henry Bedson, an expert on the pox virus group who had a major role in W.H.O.'s worldwide program of smallpox eradication. The United Nations agency helped to finance his research on the potential of unknown reservoirs of pox viruses in animals. A week after the British Government committee was appointed, the 49\u2010year\u2010old Dr. Bedson committed suicide.\n\nHis laboratory passed a Government committee's inspection in 1976. Last May, a W.H.O. inspection team identified safety hazards in the laboratory that were reported to Dr. Bedson but not to Government officials. The inspection visit followed a decision by the agency in September 1977 to reject Dr. Bedson's request that his laboratory be selected as a smallpox center collaborating with W.H.O. In a letter to an official of that agency, Dr. Bedson deplored the fact that the decision meant that his pox virus studies would have to be halted about the end of 1978.\n\nLast March, Dr. Bedson wrote the agency that the costs of upgrading his facilities to meet the agency's standards could not be justified in view of its decision not to include his center among the collaborating smallpox units. He said the risks were minimal compared with the expected benefits.\n\nHeavy Workload Is Cited\n\nThe Government committee criticized W.H.O. for not notifying British officials of the findings of the inspection, but an official of the agency said he understood that Dr. Bedson had begun taking corrective safety measures.\n\nThe investigators relate that Dr. Bedson, threatened with a cutoff from the mainstream of research in his area of expertise and fighting a deadline, took on perhaps 10 times the work load for a staff that he could no longer supervise adequately because his administrative and teaching duties had increased.\n\nOfficials of the United Nations agency apparently did not know haw much Dr. Bedson had stepped up his pace in research.",

Thus, the announcement by the World Health Organization that the most brutal form of the disease\u2014the Asian version known as variola major\u2014has not been found anywhere in two years is welcome news indeed. An international commission has now declared the Asian version officially dead in Bangladesh, its last known hideout. The accomplishment, as W.H.O. boasts, is \u201cnothing short of a public health miracle.\u201d Smallpox in all its forms has harmed more people more places over a longer period than bubonic plague, cholera or yellow fever. Vaccination drove it out North America and Europe in the 1940's, but in 1967 there were still some 10 to 15 million cases in countries. The success since then can be attributed many factors: a high degree of international cooperation; the dedication of public health workers; the development of long\u2010lasting vaccines and fast, simple ways to apply them. Serendipity, too, played a role. The original strategy was to vaccinate 80 percent of the population in afflicted countries \u2014 a costly and difficult goal. But a delay in vaccine shipments ied one health official to discover a more effective approach\u2014searching out existing cases and vaccinating only people in the surrounding areas. Thus was smallpox driven from regions where as little as 6 percent of the population had been vaccinated. Unlike other diseases the world would like to see eliminated, smallpox is uniquely vulnerable to attack. It can be diagnosed by schoolchildren, is slow to spread, and is not known to infect animals or insects from which the disease might again arise. Some experts believe that even now smallpox virus may be hiding somewhere and may emerge as a new infection. But so far that has not happened. A mild form of the disease is now making its last stand in the African Horn, where war conditions and floods hamper the eradication campaign. But health officials are confident that they will succeed there, too, and that in a few years all types of smallpox will be declared eradicated\u2014the first time that any disease has been driven from the globe.",

The disease, brought to Bangladesh by Hindu refugees returning from India, has spread to the resident Moslem population, Dr. Islam said in an interview. The extent of the outbreak, first noted late in April, has not been reported in the press, which is Government \u2014 controlled. At least 150 new cases and 50 to 60 deaths are being discovered each day in the Khulna division alone, according to an authoritative medical source.\n\nRefugees Jammed Together\n\nA doctor working in the squalid Khulna suburb of Kalishpur, where some 45,000 refugees are crowded together, said that 50 to 70 new cases were being reported daily in the noisome settlement of bamboo huts and tents.\n\nCarriers take the infection elsewhere on overloaded trains, buses and boats.\n\nIn Rangpur, where the northern transportation routes converge, smallpox is spreading from the Hindu refugees who fled to the Cooch Behar district in the Indian state of West Bengal, acquired the disease there and brought it back to Bangladesh, the health authorities say. Health workers in the smallpox\u2010ridden areas of Bangladesh place much of the blame for the epidemic on Indian officials who, they say, refused to allow American and other foreign medical teams into the refugee camps to try to control infectious disease.\n\n\u201cThere had been no smallpox in the Khulna division, except for a few sporadic cases, since 1966,\u201d Dr. Islam asserted.\n\nThe exodus of Hindus to India began during the Pakistani army's nine\u2010month crackdown on political dissidence in what was then East Pakistan.

Nearly all have returned from India, but vast numbers remain homeless and concentrated in camps and squatter settlements.\n\nThe small, sparsely equipped communicable\u2010diseases hospital in Kalishpur has been a prime source of infection through unvaccinated visitors who get the disease from patients, said Dr. Alfred Sommer of Jamaica, Queens, an epidemiologist for the World Health Organization assigned here by the United Nations relief mission in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 20\u2010bed hospital held patients, of whom about two dozen in advanced stages of smallpox were accommodated in two rooms apart. Sufferers from less severe ailments, for whom there were no beds, lay on straw mats on the concrete floor of a screened veranda.\n\nSince infections were traced to the hospital, all visitors have been checked for recent marks of vaccination, which gives immunity for three years.\n\nA Public Health Service vaccination team\u2014one of 3,500 operating throughout Bangladesh\u2014stops passers\u2010by of all ages, in Kalishpur, administering the dose with a jet gun that does the job, which is virtually painless, in a fraction of a second.",

The last civilian to gain access, a reporter for The London Times back in 1991, described only a silvery blue, chained and padlocked freezer, wrapped, for good measure, with yards of duct tape. The prisoner inside receives no visitors and hasn't seen daylight in years. Known by many names -- \"Harvey,\" \"Congo,\" \"The Great Fire,\" \"Spotted Death\" -- it is known to most of us simply as smallpox, one of the deadliest viruses of all time.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF SMALLPOX -- OR VARiOLA virus, as it is officially known at 1600 Clifton Road, home of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- coincides precisely with our own. Human beings are smallpox's only reservoir. Scientists believe that it first emerged more than 10,000 years ago among the earliest farming settlements of Asia and northeast Africa, and with the multiplications and movements of ancient peoples it spread madly throughout the world. Until its final capture in 1977, smallpox killed, blinded and disfigured millions, shaped the outcome of major battles, hastened the collapse of entire cultures.\n\nThe virus -- a minute pathogen barely visible under the most powerful microscope -- was, for much of history, identified only by its horrible effects: fiery pustules covering the face and body, profuse internal bleeding, black vomit, sloughed-off pieces of destroyed skin. One victim, a poet named Theodore Podromos living in Constantinople at the end of the 12th century, described his symptoms this way: \"First my own body is showered with hailstones from the top of the head to the nails of the toes. . . . Yes, I do justly call them hail on account of their color being white and of the shape being spherical. The body is heated violently through and through with extraordinary torches from the fever.\" The pimples \"on the seventh day become murderous pustules. Have you ever seen a violent shower of rain coming down on a lake, how the entire surface of the lake swells up on account of the closely packed bubbles? Such at this time think of my wretched flesh to have become.\"\n\nSmallpox's symptoms were unmistakable, but for the longest time their cause could only be ascribed to vagaries: foul air, angry deities, bad seeds in the blood. Even with the discovery of an effective vaccine in the late 18th century, superstition and poor hygiene often overrode science, allowing smallpox to thrive in various parts of the world right up until the 1970's. But now the devastation is done, the culprit caught and contained. In what is generally acknowledged to be the world's greatest public health triumph, a medical team under the supervision of the World Health Organization of the United Nations set out in 1966 for Central and West Africa, armed with smallpox vaccine and special jet injectors. It was to become history's most extensive microbe hunt, encompassing India, Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and South America. In the end, hundreds of millions were vaccinated, and the virus was effectively severed from its life source. The last naturally occurring case of the disease was traced to Somalia, Oct. 26, 1977. We know the victim's name: Ali Maow Maalin from the town of Merka. He survived. Now, what are thought to be the last remnants of smallpox on the planet sit in frozen vials in Atlanta and in a freezer at the Research Institute for Viral Preparation in Moscow. A simultaneous execution of smallpox was slated for midnight, Dec. 31, 1993. Death was to be by autoclave at 248 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes in the autoclave would probably be enough,\" one C.D.C. official told me in the months before the execution. \"But we'll go 45 just to be sure. Of course, the people who actually move the virus into the autoclaves will have to be vaccinated. And there will haveto be someone from the other side to observe and sign a document verifying that the execution did take place. We'll probably record it on video as well.\" World health officials, members of the original eradication program and journalists -- myself included -- planned to be on hand to witness the first purposeful extinction of a species. The sentence was never carried out. A new execution date was to be announced by the W.H.O. at the annual World Health Assembly in May. It was declared, instead, that smallpox's fate would not be decided until May 1995. Of course, many people, a number of scientists among them, find it difficult to believe that smallpox has been kept around this long, to say nothing of the fact that we -- the hapless destroyers of far worthier earthmates -- are now considering clemency.\n\n\"There was a serious scientific and financial effort made by many countries to eradicate this virus,\" Otar Andzhaparidze, the keeper of smallpox in Moscow, told me in May. \"And if it ends in nothing, it would be as if a piece of music were to end before the final note was struck.\"\n\nBut what had seemed the obvious ending for such a long-sought adversary has since given rise to a complex debate among scientists about the possible shortsightedness of such an act. Adhering to Ovid's age-old advice that \"we can learn even from our enemies,\" many virologists and biologists now claim that through the use of today's advanced genetic and molecular research techniques, study of the smallpox virus may yield invaluable information about the inner workings and possible weaknesses of the other killer viruses, most of them still at large. That we have brought something like smallpox to the brink of elimination reflects how far we as a species have advanced -- our progression from a vague, theurgically based understanding of the natural world, to a scientific and increasingly microscopic one. That we are now unable to pull the switch on smallpox merely points up the depth of mystery, promise and danger that our new microscopic focus is just beginning to expose. While the conquest of one of history's most devastating diseases would seem to betoken an increasing control over the forces that threaten us, it actually opens far more cans of microbial worms than it closes. BOOKING THE SUSPECT\n\nSmallpox has not only been caught and excised from the wild; it's been completely captured on paper as well. Last October, two months before the first planned execution date for the virus, I paid a visit to the Centers of Disease Control in hopes of viewing the captive. I was shown, instead, a thick black binder on an oak table in the office of Brian W. J. Mahy, the director of the division of viral and rickettsial diseases. Sitting beside Mahy was Joseph J. Esposito, who as chief of smallpox and other poxvirus infections coordinates the gene sequencing project.\n\n\"What you're looking at is the complete genetic code of Bangladesh 1975,\" Mahy explained. \"It's one of the more virulent strains of smallpox.\"\n\nI pulled it closer, centuries of suffering and urgent misguessing resolved in one black binder. It's not very compelling reading: the letters G, C, A or T -- for guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, the four nucleotides that make up DNA -- typed out in varying sequences, over and over, up and down the page, for hundreds of pages. But the decision to delay the destruction of smallpox has much to do with the compiling of that text, a relatively new and recently refined technology applied to the young science of virology. No one would actually see a virus in detail until 1937, the year the electron microscope was invented, and scientists are just now beginning to look inside of them to try and answer larger questions about where viruses came from, and how and why they change and continue to emerge.\n\nIn December 1979, when smallpox was declared officially eradicated, the last thing anyone had in mind for the perpetrator was doing research with it. Only four years ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, announced at a health organization meeting that \"there is no scientific reason not to destroy the remaining stocks of the wild virus.\" Now the end to a worldwide quest is being forestalled by the prospect of what might be found within the space of a few strands of DNA.\n\n\"The complete genetic code of vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine, was unraveled in 1990,\" Esposito explained, as we sat in front of Bangladesh '75 in Mahy's office and began to unravel the intricacies of the current smallpox debate. \"And here we have the code of the smallpox virus. Most of the arguments for destroying the virus preceded these two milestones. Now we're at the tip of the iceberg again. Vaccinia and smallpox are both members of the same genus. They seem to have a common ancestor. They're 98 percent the same in terms of their DNA. There are only about 13 genes that are potentially different between them, and yet one virus causes a serious disease in humans and the other doesn't. So by comparing the genes of these and other pox viruses with different virulence, we are beginning to get a notion of how they developed. There are still a great number of new insights to be gained by conducting immunological experiments in tissue cultures and mice, to try and understand how the viruses attack a host's defense system and what the Achilles' heel of smallpox is.\"\n\n\"The difficulty there,\" interjected Mahy, a slight Englishman with white hair, a whisper of a voice and a mind more or less made up to get on with the destruction of smallpox, \"is that to do such experiments requires very special conditions in which to grow the virus. There's been no vaccination since the late 1970's, so we have a lot of people who would be extremely susceptible if the virus was to get out. Nevertheless, there are powerful arguments on the other side, and I think it's fair to say. . . .\" Mahy paused a moment and smiled at his colleague, \"that even here at C.D.C. we have some differences of opinion about what to do with smallpox.\" Before arriving at Mahy's office that afternoon, Esposito had taken me for a tour of Room 211 in Building 7, the lab in which he and his team of biologists first got the book on Bangladesh '75. The project took them more than two years to complete. Within the strange, vast landscapes of microscopia where so much of science now unfolds, smallpox is considered a large virus and therefore particularly painstaking to map. Bangladesh has 187 genes whereas the polio virus has only about 12. The genetic map of a human being, by comparison, would fill at least a million of the Bangladesh-size binders.\n\nRoom 211 looks like your standard laboratory: black tables and wood cabinets, racks of glass vials, rows of petri dishes, scientists in lab coats bent over microscopes. But the room's appearance betrays little of the otherworldly deeds performed there. Gene mapping is plodding, physical work done within a fleeting, invisible realm -- a topsy-turvy, through-the-looking-glass world where the DNA of a virus is said to be \"too large to handle\" and must be \"cut up\" into workable bits with \"scissorlike\" enzymes.\n\n\"We pluck this large chunk of DNA out of the virus,\" began Esposito, a gentle, soft-spoken man with curly, dark hair, graying at the temples and the ashen complexion of a longtime lab dweller. \"It's like taking the heart out of a virus. We use enzymes that digest all the surrounding proteins, and we use detergents to dissolve away the fats, and we're left with the DNA. Then we have to use what we call restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at very specific places, leaving us with bits which we then put in a bacteria, inside a part called a plasmid. When the plasmid replicates, it also replicates the inserted bit of DNA, and then we use more enzymes and detergents to dissolve away the surrounding bacterial material. We keep paring it down this way until we have the DNA bit we want. We put the DNA between two sheets of glass with a jellylike substance in between, apply an electrical charge across that area and then pass it in front of a laser detector that excites the different dyes. From that, we can determine the sequence of smallpox's nearly 200,000 pairs of nucleotides. Bit by bit, this eventually gives us our telephone-book-size map of the virus.\"\n\nRoom 211 is designated as a biosafety level (BSL) 2 lab. In the hierarchy of precaution taken against biological threats at the C.D.C., BSL 1 and 2 are the lowest level of safety. Work is done there only with non- or moderate-risk organisms -- viruses that cause colds, for example, or bacteria that cause diarrhea. At BSL 3, work is done with organisms that cause diseases like rabies or Rocky Mountain spotted fever for which vaccines or antibiotics are available. At BSL 4, known as \"the hot zone\" or the \"blue suit lab,\" workers visit with highly transmissible viruses or with those viruses or bacteria for which there is no known cure. There are only two BSL 4 labs in the country, one at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., and the one in Atlanta.\n\nOnly the noninfectious DNA of smallpox is handled in Room 211. Room 318B, where the actual virus resides, is in a separate complex of maximum security BSL 3 and 4 labs. Esposito is one of the few people with keys to Room 318B, and neither he nor anyone else I met with in the course of my visit that day would even nod in the room's general direction. I knew, of course, that there wasn't much to see -- a room with a padlocked refrigerator -- and I suppose my desire to go there stemmed in part from themere fact that I was being told I couldn't. But somehow, after all the discussions and descriptions of smallpox and my visits to labs where people are performing what could be life-altering work and have nothing to show for it, I felt an overwhelming need to finally see some tangible evidence of the subject.\n\nC.D.C. officials, for their part, worry that the details of smallpox's incarceration may wind up in the hands of someone with bad intentions. There was, as well, the issue of my safety. Entering Room 318B would have required my being revaccinated. Vaccination against smallpox was terminated in this country in 1972, and doses of vaccine have since been reserved either for members of the military or for medical personnel authorized to handle smallpox and related viruses.\n\nOf course, there is very little chance of infection from standing next to a sealed freezer, but then odd accidents have happened. In 1978, almost a year after the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia, Janet Parker, a 40-year-old medical photographer who was working on the floor above a smallpox laboratory in Birmingham, England, contracted the disease. It has never been definitively determined how the virus reached her, but an official inquiry cited an air duct between the two floors as the most likely conduit. Unbelievably, another medical photographer working in the same room had come down with smallpox 12 years earlier. As a result of Janet Parker's illness, close to 300 people who'd come in contact with her had to be quarantined. Among those, only her mother contracted smallpox; she survived. Janet Parker did not. Near the end stages of her illness, her father visited her in the hospital and soon thereafter suffered a fatal heart attack. Eight days following the initial diagnosis of her disease, Prof. Henry Bedson, the 49-year-old director of the Birmingham Laboratory, committed suicide. After the untold millions of deaths caused by smallpox, these are the last attributed to the virus. A KILLER CONTAINED Magnified 300,000 times under an electron microscope, the world's most mulled-over microbe looks something like a tiny biscuit of shredded wheat or like a Tater Tot. Its official name, variola, derives from the Latin \"varius\" for spotted or \"varus\" for pimple. It is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, which includes, among others, cow-, buffalo-, camel-, swine- and monkeypox. These other poxes rarely infect humans; smallpox is the exception. The freezer at the Centers for Disease Control contains approximately 500 specimens of variola in half-inch-high plastic vials. There is variola minor and variola intermedius -- the less prevalent and virulent species of smallpox -- and then there is variola major, the more predominant and deadly species of the virus, with a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. Most of the specimens in the freezer were sent from European and South American countries in the wake of the incident in Birmingham. A number of African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries sent their stocks to what was then the Soviet Union. Riding on airborne droplets or on the corpses and clothes of its victims, smallpox would enter the body and penetrate a cell, co-opting that cell's mechanism of replication in order to make more of itself. That is what viruses do. That is all they do. On their own, they can't reproduce or metabolize, can't grow or even move. They have no cellular casing of their own, no cytoplasm, no inner nucleus. Viruses are just loose genetic material with a coating of protein and sometimes an added layer of fats and glucose. They are renegade shards of life, of RNA or DNA -- the information for life -- without any means of applying that information. Outside of a host cell, viruses are as inert as the books containing their genetic codes. Stedman's medical dictionary describes them as \"entities on the borderline between the living and nonliving.\" They don't live so much as they wait to enter lives in order to go about mindessly making themselves, over and over, at all costs and to no higher purpose. Smallpox is considered a very stable virus, meaning that it can wait a long time in the wild -- for decades under certain conditions -- outside of a host cell before it dies or, insofar as it wasn't living to begin with, before it loses its viability. (Human immunodeficiencity virus, or H.I.V., in contrast, is extremely unstable and difficult to transmit. After a brief moment's exposure to the air, it will wither and dissolve.) In fact, the extreme stability of smallpox has led scientists to speculate about the possibility of the virus still existing somewhere in the wild. \"One of the more heavily investigated instances was in the 17th-century Spitalfield crypts in England, back in the 1970's,\" Mahy said. \"A modern building was being erected and it was necessary to remove a lot of lead-lined coffins found at the site. An extensive investigation was done of the liquors contained in the coffins of known smallpox victims but no infectious virus was found.\" Currently, the most likely place being considered is in the permafrost of the Siberian tundra. A team of Russian scientists recently uncovered cadavers of smallpox victims there. Tests of tissue samples did reveal smallpox antigens or proteins, but not the intact infectious virus. As for the question of what a virus that thrives only within us was doing prior to us, no one can say exactly. \"We have a hint,\" Esposito said, \"that smallpox as well as cowpox and the others of the genus emerged from a common rodent ancestor, a virus whose reservoir was a rodent.\"\n\nWhatever its origin, smallpox is believed to have formerly been one of the harmless pox strains that infect domesticated animals. Then, through pro longed proximity to the early farmers of Africa and Asia, it made what's known in virology as a cross-species transfer, genetically mutating in such a way as to leap over and adapt to us. From Africa, it is thought to have spread to the Hittites in the 14th century B.C. and later to ancient Greece and Persia, and from the Persians to the Huns and with them into China where the disease was known as \"Hunpox.\" Alexander the Great's army was ravaged by smallpox during a campaign in India in the fourth century B.C. The mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses in the Cairo Museum shows signs of death by smallpox. In ancient Greece, the loss of faith in the sanctity of the polis and the subsequent decline of Athens is thought to have been largely the work of variola major. In his book, \"Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History,\" Donald R. Hopkins, a member of the original eradication program in West and Central Africa, cites Thucydides' description of a devastating smallpox epidemic in 430 B.C.: \"Athens owed to the plague the beginnings of a state of unprecedented lawlessness. . . . As for the gods, it seemed to be the same thing whether one worshipped them or not when one saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately.\"\n\nSmallpox ravaged Rome with a major epidemic in the second century A.D., killing the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It spread across Europe and would continue to visit plagues upon its major cities up until the end of the 19th century. Generations of European royalty were ravaged by smallpox. In the 16th century, the disease was introduced into southern Mexico by one African slave on board the ship of the conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez and it would end up killing millions of Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, facilitating the Spanish conquest. The native peoples of North America and Canada were devastated by smallpox disseminated, at times intentionally, by settlers. In 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander in chief of British forces in North America, ordered his troops to hand out smallpox-contaminated blankets among the Iroquois. This is the first known instance of biological warfare.",

            "HeadLine": "The 1947 Smallpox Vaccination Campaign in New York City, Revisited",
            "Text": "In 1947, millions of New Yorkers received smallpox vaccinations, an accomplishment still appropriately held up as an example of public health planing and mobilization. Although now mythological, a review of the events of April 1947, from copies of The New York Times (1,2), tells of a more recognizably human response: pushing, jawing, deceit, shortages, surpluses, and perhaps a unusual way of counting vaccinees.\n\nIn March 1947, a patient who had recently visited Mexico traveled by bus to New York City. He became ill, was hospitalized, and, after his death, found to have had smallpox. The occasional case of smallpox had been seen in the area for decades since the last big outbreak in 1875, which had killed 2,000 New Yorkers. However, in 1947, a second case and then a third appeared and concern gathered. On April 4, Israel Weinstein, the New York City Health Commissioner, urged all New Yorkers who had not been vaccinated since childhood to receive another vaccination.\n\nThe program worked at the outset. Free vaccine clinics were established throughout the city, and doses were given to private physicians for administration. During the first week, surprisingly little public attention was captured (Times articles typically were brief and confined to page 21). The story hit page 1 on April 13 (3), after a second person died from the disease. Mayor William O\u2019Dwyer urged all 7.8 million New York residents to receive the vaccine, and he rolled up his sleeve and was vaccinated by Dr. Weinstein. The city swiftly swung into full crisis mode. Police, fire, and health departments, and hospitals were mobilized to provide additional space for the effort.\n\nTwo days later, epidemiologic investigation indicated that all patients with diagnosed cases were related and that, in all likelihood, the outbreak had been successfully halted through tracing the movements of the various patients and vaccinating anyone who had contact with them, so-called \u201cring\u201d vaccination (4). Despite this halt of the outbreak, the city pushed forward. The campaign to \u201cBe sure, be safe, get vaccinated!\u201d had proven successful. By city estimate, >600,000 persons had received vaccine in the first week.\n\nVaccine side effects, which dominate coverage of today\u2019s vaccination program, were seldom discussed in 1947. Dr. Weinstein assured residents, \u201cVaccination is painless. The skin is not even broken by the needle. Sometimes a soreness develops in the armpit. If the arm becomes very sore, apply an icebag\u201d (4). This advice is simple compared to the depth and breadth of information given today to a potential vaccinee. Now, volunteers are given several informational lectures and a protracted individual interview to discuss lingering questions, and they are required to sign a document confirming adequate comprehension and acceptance of the risks.\n\nIn the 1947 campaign, trouble began on April 16, when (no longer on page 1), the Times announced, \u201cVaccinations Stop; Drug Supply Gone; Thousands Turned Away\u201d (5). With little warning, and at the height of the program, the vaccine supply vanished, something that was never explained. After spending days gearing up citizens to receive the vaccine quickly, the mayor and Dr. Weinstein now had to downplay the urgency of receiving vaccination. They assured New Yorkers that a delay of a few days or more represented \u201cno health hazard\u201d (5).\n\nOf the 1.2 million doses distributed to date, 42,000 had been supplied by private laboratories, far short of the promised number. In contrast, the Army and Navy had given almost 800,000 doses, and the city\u2019s public health laboratories had made another 400,000.\n\nDuring the shortage, the Times noted, \u201chundreds of eager men, women, and children queued up at Bellevue Hospital at dawn, although vaccinations were not scheduled to begin until 10 a.m. At some stations, the crowds did not take kindly to the news that the doctors had run out of vaccine and the police had a little difficulty dispersing a crowd of several hundred\u201d outside one vaccine station (5).\n\nOn April 17, the situation brightened, when more than a million doses arrived from private laboratories, and 500,000 persons were vaccinated (6). As the crisis slowly lessened, doctors were recruited at US$8 (US$64 in today\u2019s market) for a 3-hour session (or US$24 for all day; US$192 in today\u2019s market) to administer vaccine, but few volunteered. Public health authorities in Westchester County chided local physicians for charging $35 per vaccine (7), and a 29-year-old woman, dressed up as a nurse, vaccinated 500 people with water to impress her \u201cman companion\u201d until she was sent to the Bellevue psychiatric ward for evaluation (8).\n\nContinued complaints about side effects were dismissed as minor nuisances by Dr. Weinstein, who again advised those whose arm ached that they only needed to place an icebag in the armpit for relief. Within a week, the program had wound down and been proclaimed \u201ca miracle\u201d (2) by all involved.\n\nThe claim of 5 or 6 million vaccinations administered cannot be reconciled against the daily tally reported in the Times. If one assumes that day-to-day numbers reported in the newspaper were roughly accurate, a simple calculation places the number of vaccinees closer to 2.5 million, far short of the announced total. On April 21, a grand total of 3.45 million recipients were reported; the next day, after noting that only 200,000 additional persons had received vaccine, the total became 4.4 million (9).\n\nAlthough the numbers are plausible, these data reflect the difficulties intrinsic to managing such a massive program. The discrepancy may simply be a case of not adding columns of numbers in a systematic way; the fuzzy numbers do have a certain appeal to the modern, more cynical reader.\n\nWhatever occurred, understanding the specifics of \u201cthe great vaccination miracle\u201d of 1947 is important for maintaining equilibrium during our current smallpox vaccination program and any future programs directed at now-unanticipated infections. Not just New York City\u2019s, but the entire country\u2019s sense of confidence that it can handle a major rapid vaccination or pill distribution campaign leans very heavily on the apocryphal vaccine campaign of April 1947. Yet, as described above, there may be much less to the miracle than met the eye.",

            "Text": "SWIFTWATER, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The drug company Aventis Pasteur will donate to the U.S. government the estimated 85 million to 90 million doses of smallpox vaccine that had been in storage since routine smallpox vaccination ended in 1972, it was announced Friday.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said a formal agreement had not yet been signed, pending the results of testing to determine the vaccine is safe and effective.\n\n\"This will bolster our emergency smallpox stockpile, provide an extra layer of protection for all Americans in the event of a smallpox outbreak and strengthen our safety net in the event of a biological attack,\" Thompson said. He said scientists have been \"extremely encouraged by the initial results\" of tests on the vaccine, and called the additional vaccines an \"insurance policy\" until more vaccines are made.\n\nGovernment sources said Thursday the frozen vaccine was discovered several months ago and then the company and HHS began discussions about what to do with it.\n\nBut Aventis Pasteur said Friday that government agencies had known about the stored doses \"for many years prior\" to its discovery.\n\n\"It was in our freezers. It's just that it was unimportant until the events of last fall,\" Aventis CEO Richard J. Markham said.\n\nThe company said the National Institutes of Health would conduct clinical studies \"to confirm efficacy and to determine the potential for diluting the vaccine, which could result in substantially more doses being available,\" the company said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will also review the drug, the company said, under the sponsorship of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThompson said the Aventis vaccine had so far proven hardy during the first rounds of testing, but that the human clinical trials were necessary to guarantee that the responses to the drug are good. Although those tests are under way, it will take about six months to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective and can be diluted.\n\nAventis Pasteur is based in Lyon, France.

            "Text": "Next week, researchers at St. Louis University begin tests on the U.S. supply of smallpox vaccine. The vaccine hasn't been used in this country for more than 20 years, and it's been decades since anyone in the United States actually had the disease. Why the concern now?\n\nAs \"CNN NEWSSTAND\"'s Garrick Utley tells us, there's a remote chance the virus could be used as a weapon.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nGARRICK UTLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We see what terrorists can do with explosives, with bombs that bring down buildings, that ignite carnage, that consume lives.\n\nBut imagine a terrorist weapon more dangerous than any explosive, thousands of times more deadly in the hands of a Timothy McVeigh or Osama bin Laden or Ted Kaczynski, a weapon so small that you can't see it at first, a biological weapon: smallpox.\n\nThe disease has been eradicated, but not the smallpox virus, which was originally preserved in laboratories in the United States and Russia solely for research reasons, but now may have been obtained for other purposes by nations such as North Korea and Iraq.\n\nOSTERHOLM: A biologic terrorism event will happen. I have absolutely no doubt about that, and I say that will all the hope that I'm wrong.\n\nUTLEY: There are several potential biological killers, including anthrax and plague, but Mike Osterholm, who runs the Infectious Control Advisory Network, is most worried about smallpox.\n\nOSTERHOLM: Without a doubt, smallpox is, by far, the most serious of all the weapons. The fact that smallpox is able to be transmitted as a second, third, fourth round after the initial hit, it's like a bomb that keeps going off.\n\nPRESTON: Ounce for ounce, gram for gram, smallpox is far more dangerous than plutonium.\n\nUTLEY: Richard Preston, of \"The New Yorker\" magazine has investigated and written about smallpox.\n\nPRESTON: It is highly contagious. It travels through the air. One person infected with smallpox can easily infect 20 to 30 more people.\n\nUTLEY (on camera): And that's how it spreads.\n\nPRESTON: It spreads like wildfire.\n\nUTLEY (voice-over): And the effects are deadly. First, the victim's skin essentially explodes, then internal hemorrhaging follows.\n\nConsider this: In the 20th century, it was estimated that 120 million people died of wars or as a result of wars. In the same century, more than 500 million people died of smallpox.\n\nD.A. HENDERSON: Small pox was probably the most greatly feared of all the diseases that we have.\n\nUTLEY: D.A. Henderson led the worldwide effort against small pox in the 1970s. The last reported case was in Somalia in 1977. He has seen what this disease can do.\n\nHENDERSON: There's no treatment possible, and it spread in every country, in every climate. Eventually, everyone either contracted smallpox and lived or died.\n\nUTLEY: In 1796, an effective smallpox vaccine was developed in England by Edward Jenner, yet it was nearly two centuries until the disease was finally eradicated. When that was achieved, the vaccinations stopped.\n\nBy the late 1970s, smallpox was out of sight and out of most people's minds. That was until Ken Alibek defected to the United States in 1992. A high-level scientist in the Soviet Union's bioweapons program, Alibek revealed that the Soviets had realized there was no longer any protection against smallpox and decided to turn the virus into a weapon.\n\nKEN ALIBEK, DEFECTOR: Sometime in 1980s, they had up to 20 tons of stockpiled biological weapons.\n\nUTLEY (on camera): Twenty tons?\n\nALIBEK: Twenty tons.\n\nUTLEY: That would be enough to do what?\n\nALIBEK: It's difficult to calculate, but I would say for destroying a city like New York, it be would be enough to have several hundred liters of this weapon.\n\nUTLEY: And there are 20 tons.\n\nALIBEK: There are 20 tons. UTLEY (voice-over): In his book, \"Biohazard,\" Alibek writes that although the Soviet Union played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox, although the Soviets agreed in 1972 to stop biochemical weapons research and production, the smallpox weapons program continued in secret, even during Mikhail Gorbachev's proclaimed openness and reforms, and may even be continuing today.\n\nALIBEK: In my opinion, Russia is still not honest. The Russian military still has four biological weapons facilities as top secret facilities.\n\nHENDERSON: And needless to say, I feel anger and disappointment with our Soviet colleagues. We all worked together to get rid of this disease, and then to have them do what they did, I find this unconscionable.\n\nUTLEY (on camera): There's great concern that these biological weapons, above all smallpox, could get out of Russian control, get into the hands of someone such as a terrorists and be used. To what extent do you consider this to be a real clear and present danger?\n\nALIBEK: In my opinion, it's a clear and present danger. A lot of terrorist organizations, many so-called \"old countries,\" realize that biological weapons could be the weapons of choice just to commit some terrorist attacks.\n\nPRESTON: A number of years ago, when this first became an issue, there were those of us in the public health community who were very reluctant to talk about this, because we didn't want to incite something, we didn't want to give the bad guys information. Well, we found out the bad guys all had, that we were the ones that didn't really know about it.\n\nUTLEY (on camera): If you were infected with smallpox virus today, you probably would have a bad cough, run a fever and develop a rash, and go to your doctor or hospital's emergency room for treatment. Unfortunately, the doctor, no matter how competent, would almost certainly never have seen a case of smallpox, and most likely would diagnose it as the flu.\n\nHENDERSON: Then there would be some small lesions on the skin. You wouldn't be sure what they were for maybe two, three, four days.\n\nPRESTON: Could be measles, could be a little itch, could be anything, but then the rash just gets worse and worse and worse, until the skin on the body just bubbles up with enormous \"pustuals\" that look like blisters.\n\nHENDERSON: And then in two, three, four days, you begin to see, it becomes evident the this wasn't chickenpox or ti wasn't a drug rash, had to be small pox.\n\nUTLEY: And you'd be scared.\n\nHENDERSON: We'd be terrified, because each of those individuals then is in a position to transmit it to another group of people. UTLEY (voice-over): That is why in this era of more open borders and increased travel, public health experts are so worried about small pox.\n\nOSTERHOLM: To be able to move smallpox simply means to have a device within a writing ink pen that could pass in any customs office, could very easily pass through and metal detector, and you can have enough smallpox in there to start the world's first epidemic.\n\nHENDERSON: It could quickly evaporate into the air and would begin to drift. The individuals would breathe this in. You wouldn't smell it. You wouldn't know it was there.\n\nOSTERHOLM: If a smallpox virus release were to occur in any mall in the world, if it were to occur in any airport, it would be two weeks before we'd have our first evidence that that was occurring, and those people would be like dandelion seeds in the wind -- they'd be all over. Each of them is infectious, has that first initial hit was.\n\nDR. JEFFREY COPELAND, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL: I would not put smallpox on my list of daily -- on everyone's list of daily worries.\n\nUTLEY: Dr. Jeffrey Copeland is the director of the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control. Early in his career, he treated smallpox.\n\nCOPELAND: We need to keep in mind that smallpox is treatable, not treatable as a disease, but preventable, and in the early stages of the disease, the vaccine can be effective in aborting an outbreak.\n\nUTLEY: Twenty years ago, a terrorist smallpox attack on the United States or any industrialized nation would have had little impact, because everyone was inoculated against it. Today, virtually no one is. And those of us who were are most likely no longer immune.\n\nThe United States has, at most, 15 million doses of vaccine, not nearly enough, public health authorities say, to combat a serious outbreak of the disease.\n\nCOPELAND: We are doing some studies now to see whether we can extend that to a larger number of usable doses. Nevertheless, I think for the long term, we would probably want to have on stock a somewhat larger repository.\n\nHENDERSON: I think many of us feel that if we had somewhere between 100 million and 130 million doses, that we would be well- prepared to deal with any situation.\n\nCOPELAND: Producing smallpox vaccine is a high priority for us, and we just recently put out a request for companies to send us proposals to produce vaccine. We would have to produce new vaccine, and there's no vaccine manufacturing company currently producing vaccine, so we're talking about a couple of years or maybe a few more than that. OSTERHOLM: The vaccine issue is a sad state of affairs in this country. We have been talking about this issue since the mid-1990s and in a very high level, knowing very well that every day that we wasted on not get getting more vaccine produced is one more day we were very vulnerable.\n\nUTLEY: Behind the debate over what to do about a potential small pox threat are the reminders of what that threat, the disease, once meant, and the awareness of how the current danger might have been avoided. When smallpox disappeared, the last remaining viruses in laboratories could have been destroyed, too. They were not.\n\nPRESTON: There was a golden moment there. At that time, if they had gone and they had said, let's just destroy our smallpox, it might have been done. Now the opportunity is lost, and I feel that smallpox is here to stay.\n\nOSTERHOLM: If there's a potential that smallpox is going to get out, that will be a Pandora's Box that we will never ever forget.\n\nCOPELAND: It's hard to imagine someone with enough evil intent to want to do that to other people, but we live in a real world and evil things are happening all the time, and we need to be prepared for it.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nNATALIE ALLEN, CNN ANCHOR: \"NEWSSTAND\" contacted Ken Alibek's old boss in Russia. He says the Russian stocks of smallpox virus are safe and adequately protected and any allegations that Russia may still be making bioweapons are baseless.\n\nTo get a medical perspective on all of this, we asked Dr. Steve Salvatore to join us.\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nDR. STEVE SALVATORE, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Natalie.\n\nALLEN: Scary stuff we just watched. As one of the men said, you know, there are evil things that people do. It's scary to imagine that doctors today wouldn't know smallpox. Could this be treated? And I guess that's a tough question to answer if doctors wouldn't know it in the first place.\n\nSALVATORE: Right, and especially, Natalie, because it's so tricky. Now, the last case was seen, I believe, in Somalia in 1977. I personally have never seen one, most of the doctors I know have never seen one, and only the doctors, maybe some of the old-timers, who have been around have seen one.\n\nBut the tricky thing about it is that it presents really like the flu. And in those first couple of weeks while it is looking like the flu and no rash has come out, that's when you're infectious, so you could spread it.\n\nBut we don't want people to really get panicky. When you see a report like this, it's something that scares people to death. You have to realize that these agents and other agents have been around since the '60s and '70s. There's nerve gas out there that could be used to kill lots -- large numbers of people, serin gas, there are other infectious agents.\n\nThe bottom line is that people are not vaccinated at this time for smallpox. If the government decided that it was a real threat, they probably would try to get enough vaccines out there and get people vaccinated. The biggest tool you have against this is vaccination because, like they said in the report, early on you might have some kind of benefit, but it takes weeks, months to develop full immunity and you need a booster shot every, like, 10 years or so. But also immunoglobulins and mostly supportive treatment will be what doctors do to try to get you through this course. And what that means is that if you become dehydrated, they would give you intravenous fluids. If could not breathe properly, they would put a tube down your throat and help you breathe.\n\nSo there are supportive seeings-through. But remember, the mortality rate in this is about 20 to 40 percent. So initially there probably would be some deaths, but we might be able to catch that later.\n\nALLEN: Steve Salvatore, thanks for joining us to talk more about this today.\n\nSALVATORE: Sure.\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com",

            "Text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A government advisory panel recommended Thursday against routine resumption of smallpox vaccinations in the United States.\n\nThe panel with the Centers for Disease Control did however vote in favor of vaccinating two groups -- state smallpox \"response\" teams and those people who work at hospitals or facilities that deal with or treat smallpox.\n\nThat amounts to about 10,000 to 15,000 people.\n\nRoutine smallpox vaccinations were discontinued in the United States in 1972, and the disease was eradicated globally in 1980. But after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, government officials began stockpiling vaccine and looking at U.S. vaccination policy because of the possible use of the virus in a biological weapon. Dr. Walter Ornstein, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Program, said diphtheria, measles and mumps are much more contagious than smallpox, which is not easily transmitted airborne -- and smallpox's obvious symptoms would key doctors into its presence quickly. The smallpox vaccine is effective even if given several days after a person is exposed to the disease.\n\nBut Dr. Donald A. Henderson, director of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Public Health Preparedness, told the panel that it is possible to dry the smallpox virus and add stabilizers so it can persist a long time in the air like anthrax, making its spread less predictable.\n\n\"Whether the smallpox vaccine should be made available hinges on one question: How big is the threat of a bioterrorism attack with smallpox?\" said Dr. Don Millar, an environmental hazards expert who has worked with the CDC in the past.\n\nThe threat of a smallpox outbreak must be tempered with the hazards of the smallpox vaccine itself, argues Dr. Thomas Mack, a professor of preventative medicine with 40 years experience in population outbreaks.\n\nAnother problem: A short supply of vaccinia immunoglobin (VIG) -- the antidote used to treat patients who develop complications related to the vaccine.\n\n\"This is the single most dangerous live virus vaccine we have,\" Mack said. \"We don't need vaccination. We need ... personnel\" to track reports of the disease and react quickly.\"\n\nWeighing the risks\nMass vaccinations carry with them other risks, as well, particularly to those with compromised immune systems, such as HIV patients, cancer patients, organ transplant patients and those with certain skin conditions.\n\nIn a government-funded study earlier this year, one-third of the 680 healthy young volunteers getting the vaccine had a reaction serious enough to interfere with school or work.\n\nHowever, smallpox itself is even more lethal. Before it was eradicated in 1980, about one-third of those affected died and others were left severely scarred or blind.\n\nBut, several of the scientists said, mass communication is much more effective now than it was as recently as 30 years ago, making it more unlikely that an outbreak of smallpox could take hold.\n\n\"Look, if this happened today, we'd have CNN, who'd be screaming the names of the persons who were exposed and if you'd been exposed to that person you'd go out and get the vaccine,\" said Dr. J. Michael Lane, a former CDC employee now working with the center on smallpox issue.",

Is this enough to deal with a possible outbreak? Explain. Why has the Bush administration decided to expand its stockpile of smallpox vaccine? How much will it cost to expand the stockpile? Who is Tommy Thompson?

Who developed the smallpox vaccine, and when was it developed? How much later was it before smallpox was eradicated?\n\n4. Inform your students that in China, 100 years before Edward Jenner, people took pills made from the fleas of cows to prevent smallpox. This was the earliest form of oral vaccination.

Help satisfy their curiosity by helping students research vaccinations and their effectiveness. Students will want to learn more about the smallpox vaccination and the immunizations they have received for other diseases including, measles, mumps, chicken pox and some strains of hepatitis.

            "Text": "You just had to look at a smallpox sufferer to be horrified. It was very much a lottery ticket, which most people didn't want to buy. JAMES WILSON, PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, UCL: The eradication of smallpox is one of the most significant events in the 20th Century. For me it would be up there with the moon landing. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE STORY OF THE ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX? IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALONE, SMALLPOX KILLED AN ESTIMATE OF 300+ MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THAT'S MORE THAN BOTH WORLD WARS PUT TOGETHER. PROF GEOFFREY SMITH, HEAD OF PATHOLOGY, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY: You certainly couldn't miss a patient who had got smallpox. SUSANNA BIDGOOD, RESEARCH SCIENTIST, UCL: You had these blisters, these lesions all over your skin. All these pustules were filled with virus. LIKE COVID-19, SMALLPOX WAS TRANSMITTED BY BREATHING IN DROPLETS OR TOUCHING A CONTAMINATED SURFACE. SMALLPOX WOULD KILL 30% OF ALL PEOPLE THAT CAUGHT THE VIRUS. SURVIVORS WOULD OFTEN BE LEFT DISFIGURED, BLINDED OR INFERTILE. SMALLPOX IS THOUGHT TO HAVE FOUND ITS WAY INTO HUMAN POPULATIONS AROUND 10,000 YEARS AGO, SHAPING HUMAN HISTORY WITH DEVASTATION FOR MILLENNIA. SMALLPOX SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD WITH CRUSADING ARMIES, TRADE, SLAVERY AND COLONISATION. THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT PROTECTING AGAINST THE VIRUS WAS A PROCESS CALLED VARIOLATION. THIS INVOLVED DELIBERATELY INFECTING A PERSON WITH SMALLPOX MATTER. VARIOLATION ORIGINATED IN ASIA AND WAS FIRST PRACTISED IN CHINA AND INDIA. SANJOY BHATTACHARYA: India, as in the Mughal Empire, understood the value of variolation because it saw smallpox as a threat to military power. THE PRACTICE WAS INITIALLY REJECTED IN THE WEST, BEFORE BECOMING WIDESPREAD AROUND THE WORLD. JAMES WILSON: But the problem was that it was as risky as it sounds you're basically trying to stop a deadly disease by giving somebody a mild case of the same deadly disease. SANJOY BHATTACHARYA: Variolation could lead to uncontrolled epidemics. BY THE 18TH CENTURY, SMALLPOX WAS A CONSTANT THREAD IN EUROPE. DR ERICA CHARTERS, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE, OXFORD UNIVERSITY: People knew that this was something that their children would catch and they might survive or they might die from it and so it was part of the cycle of life. IN 1796, THERE WAS A BREAKTHROUGH. BRITISH PHYSICIAN EDWARD JENNER MADE A KEY DISCOVERY... ARCHIVE NEWS REPORT: When Jenner inoculated the arm of James Phipps, a young boy of eight, with the contents of a cowpox bled from a dairy maid, it became possible for the first time to protect human beings artificially against pathogenic organisms. GEOFFREY SMITH,: This really tipped the table in favour of prevention and eradication. SUSANNA BIDGOOD: To people in the 1700s, this was totally mind-blowing. SANJOY BHATTACHARYA: Jenner's idea was a game changer. THIS LED TO THE WORLD'S FIRST EVER VACCINE. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE A LONG TIME BEFORE THE VACCINE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. IN 1945, SMALLPOX WAS STILL WIDESPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE. SANJOY BHATTACHARYA: What happens in 1948 after the Second World War, the horrors of the Second World War, is that the world agrees that a new world order was needed. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WAS CREATED IN 1948. ERICA CHARTERS: What a crazy idea it would be to say that you're going to institute vaccination throughout the entire world. BUT THAT\u2019S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. ARCHIVE NEWS REPORT: The 11th World Health Assembly approved a resolution in 1958 calling for worldwide smallpox eradication. GEOFFREY SMITH: The WHO galvanised enthusiasm, they standardised the vaccine, obtained the resources that they needed internationally. They really deserve tremendous credit for that. THE ERADICATION PROGRAMME WAS LAUNCHED IN 1967. SUSANNA BIDGOOD: People running the programme were going from door to door with pictures of a child with smallpox and asking people in the community if they knew anyone who had this disease. QUARANTINE MEASURES AND CONTACT TRACING WERE NEEDED TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUALS WITH SMALLPOX SYMPTOMS. JAMES WILSON: You're tracking, testing, isolating. It's a strategy which many people have said will be the only way we can keep on top of Covid-19. ARCHIVE NEWS REPORT: May,1980. Two men affix their signatures to an historic document. SMALLPOX WAS DECLARED ERADICATED ON 8 MAY 1980. SANJOY BHATTACHARYA: National and local health workers played an immense role in the eradication of smallpox, whether it's in Africa or in Asia often selflessly, because a disease like smallpox was as threatening to them as Covid-19 is to today's health workers. JAMES WILSON: It's interesting that we're often so eager to commemorate success in wars, but that much less is done to celebrate success in the control of disease. The eradication of smallpox is one of the most significant events in the 20th Century. For me it would be up there with the moon landing. SUSANNA BIDGOOD: We've eradicated smallpox. And because we've eradicated smallpox we know that we can eradicate other human diseases. If we all work together to tackle the disease, to stop it spreading, to protect ourselves, there is no reason why we can't stop another pandemic like we stopped smallpox.",

            "Text": "Edward Jenner was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire on 17 May 1749, the son of the local vicar. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local surgeon and then trained in London. In 1772, he returned to Berkeley and spent most the rest of his career as a doctor in his native town.\n\nIn 1796, he carried out his now famous experiment on eight-year-old James Phipps. Jenner inserted pus taken from a cowpox pustule and inserted it into an incision on the boy's arm. He was testing his theory, drawn from the folklore of the countryside, that milkmaids who suffered the mild disease of cowpox never contracted smallpox, one of the greatest killers of the period, particularly among children. Jenner subsequently proved that having been inoculated with cowpox Phipps was immune to smallpox. He submitted a paper to the Royal Society in 1797 describing his experiment, but was told that his ideas were too revolutionary and that he needed more proof. Undaunted, Jenner experimented on several other children, including his own 11-month-old son. In 1798, the results were finally published and Jenner coined the word vaccine from the Latin 'vacca' for cow.\n\nJenner was widely ridiculed. Critics, especially the clergy, claimed it was repulsive and ungodly to inocculate someone with material from a diseased animal. A satirical cartoon of 1802 showed people who had been vaccinated sprouting cow's heads. But the obvious advantages of vaccination and the protection it provided won out, and vaccination soon became widespread. Jenner became famous and now spent much of his time researching and advising on developments in his vaccine. Jenner carried out research in a number of other areas of medicine and was also keen on fossil collecting and horticulture. He died on 26 January 1823.",

            "Text": "Controlling the next phase of the coronavirus outbreak is likely to depend on contact tracing - tracking down anyone who has been in contact with a person showing symptoms of the virus.\n\nIt will involve tracing anyone who has come into close contact with someone who has tested positive and advising them to self-isolate to stop further spread.\n\nJournalist James Stewart argues there are lessons to be learned from one of the last big contact-tracing exercises - carried out almost 60 years ago during the smallpox outbreak of 1962.\n\nAn official report from the time concluded that \"the importance of tracing, and adequate surveillance of contacts cannot be denied\".\n\nBut there were several challenges for those trying to track down anyone who might be at risk from the smallpox virus.\n\nIn the 1960s, the work of contact tracing fell to staff of what is now called the environmental health department - in those days they were known as health inspectors and, in an emergency, they came under the jurisdiction of the local medical officer of health.\n\nAfter limited outbreaks in London and Birmingham, the 1962 smallpox epidemic was focused on Cardiff and the valleys of south Wales, where 19 people died and almost a million were vaccinated against the disease.\n\nVernon Bryant was a young health inspector in the Rhondda valley at the time. Interviewed around the 40th anniversary of the outbreak he recalled how he would question anyone showing symptoms.\n\n\"I would come along and ask where they had been or who they'd been in contact with going back 28 days. If they remembered someone, I would move on to them. But it was very difficult relying on people's memory.\"\n\nA report on contact tracing by Allan R Davis, the medical officer of health in the adjoining district of Llantrisant and Llanwit Fardre put it more precisely: \"Probably the most important and reliable source was the patient himself.\n\n\"It was imperative to obtain the most detailed and accurate account of the patient's movements, and names and addresses of persons with whom he had been in contact.\n\n\"Details of dates, times and places must be especially accurate when the patient has visited public places such as cafes, clubs or public houses or when he has used public transport.\n\n\"This is not always as easy as it may seem, since the patient's memory may not be too accurate on minor events which occurred some days previously and particularly as he may well be seriously ill with added mental confusion.\"",

Health inspectors worked day and night to hunt down smallpox contacts.\n\nAs doctors struggled to vaccinate the entire population of the two valleys, there were even calls from outside for the Rhondda valleys to be isolated.\n\nAnother of the health inspectors in Rhondda at the time was Nimrod Griffiths, who told his story in 2002. He recalled working into the night in order to track down people who may have been at work during the day.\n\nIf they had any symptoms, they would be isolated - and it was part of the job to visit them and deliver food if necessary. A knock on the door from a health inspector was a shock. \"It was a worrying time,\" he recalled. \"People were in fear of this unknown disease. It was part of our job to reassure them. If they had been vaccinated, they were protected.\"\n\nAccording to the official report on contact tracing, the second vital source of information was the patient's family, workmates and friends.\n\n\"This information had a snowball effect, as it was common when visiting a friend to be given the names of one or two more friends who were also contacts, and when these were visited, further names were forthcoming.\" Appeals for information in the media were the third approach, but this could be a blunt instrument.\n\n\"At times the office was inundated with names and it was important to distinguish as soon as possible between those who were true contacts and those who had no contact, otherwise the machinery for surveillance would have been overwhelmed.\"\n\nIn many cases dates and times were found to be inaccurate - or outside the infectious period.\n\nSmallpox was eventually eradicated worldwide by 1980.\n\nScientists believe Covid-19 could be around for a long time. So tracking and controlling the virus will be vital.\n\nIn the conclusion of his 1962 report, Allan R Davis highlighted the lack of any legislation requiring the reporting of contacts - and gave a warning which may be relevant for those engaged in tracking down contacts of patients with coronavirus.\n\n\"The efficiency of the present system depends solely on the goodwill and co-operation of the general public,\" wrote Dr Davis.\n\n\"By and large this appears to work well, but the contact who does not report for personal reasons is very likely to be missed and the result may well be disastrous.\"",

It could strike alarmingly quickly, leading to collapse and death within days or even hours. For some, symptoms included lungs with a blue-ish fluid and bleeding from the ears or nose.\n\nWorld War One played a factor in spreading the disease, as troops moved back and forth between their homes, bases and front line.\n\nFuneral notices of flu victims started to appear next to the names of those killed in action in local newspapers.\n\nBut the full impact of the epidemic was missing in a media still consumed by the war, subject to censorship and taken by surprise.  Ivor Hiley, 32, the son of a butcher from Barry, had managed a drapery business before the war.\n\nHe had arrived at Newport railway station, on leave from the Royal Field Artillery, where he had been working in the ammunition supply lines in France. He had walked the eight miles (13km) home by midnight but reportedly by the morning was already showing signs of flu. He died on December 16.\n\nBoth Maud and Molly had developed pneumonia while Ivor's complications included meningitis. Maud's brother also died in the outbreak while other family members were infected but survived.\n\nCouncil-appointed medical officers of health were at the vanguard of dealing with the outbreak on the ground.\n\nAccording to Monmouthshire medical officer Dr David Rocyn-Jones, the epidemic \"spread with alarming rapidity\".\n\nDr Rocyn-Jones - a former doctor and colliery surgeon in Abertillery - said the infection generally attacked men working in the pits, followed by the mothers and older children \"and finally the children attending the infant schools\". But many soldiers died too.\n\nJohn Williams, 22, was a milkman before he spent nearly three years as a private in the transport section of the South Wales Borderers. He was given leave after contracting flu and came home to Cwmdare. He died the day before the end of the war.\n\nMiner Daniel Davies died two days after the end of the war while on home leave in Llandeilo, another veteran of the Royal Field Artillery.",

            "Text": "It is 100 years since the influenza pandemic killed millions around the world, a death toll far worse than the bubonic plague. But what is the chance of something similar happening again? New strains of flu continue to emerge and experts warn that another pandemic could happen despite a century of advances in technology and healthcare.\n\nDuring the 1918-19 outbreak, it was thought that Spanish flu was caused by bacteria rather than a virus. Viruses are now better understood, but scientists have also learned a great deal from studying the pandemic which struck a century ago. They learned how very differently it could behave to our usual experience of seasonal flu. It hit proportionately more younger and healthier adults. Experts believe older people who were infected by Spanish flu may have previously encountered a similar strain, and therefore had a degree of immunity. Dr Niall Johnson, who published a study of the 1918-19 pandemic says the medical profession a century ago was familiar with infectious disease, but not at this scale.\n\n\"Many of the medical memoirs mention the pandemic, and often say that it was not the presentation of the disease that was unusual but the sheer volume of cases - and how little they could offer people,\" he said. \"With some flu viruses - it was true in 1918 and in 2009 - one of things which happens is that the way that flu kills you is not the flu itself,\" he said. \"It's what it does to your lungs, it sort of melts the linings and then you get a bacterial pneumonia... that will kill you.\n\n\"They didn't have antibiotics then, so they died faster. But the other thing that happens, particularly in young people when they have a good, active immune system is that your body overreacts. It ends up just filling your lungs with fluid. A lot of these deaths weren't from the bacterial complications, but from an explosion of the immune system.\"\n\nDr Johnson says the impact of new viruses today will vary, for several reasons. These include vaccines that may confer some immunity, anti-viral drugs, better hygiene and antimicrobials that deal with the infections such as pneumonia, that were major contributors to the death rate in the 1918-19.\n\n\"So, yes, I think we are better placed than in 1918 but the potential for a pandemic to be a global infection that sickens the majority of the world's population and kills a substantial number is still there.\"\n\nDr Quick believes such a scenario is not inevitable, if more is done to make the world safer and prepared.\n\n\"One of the most important things is to invest in the so-called universal flu vaccine,\" he says - one which works against all strains of the virus, by targeting the part of the virus which doesn't change.",

One nine-year-old girl from Coventry whose 35-year-old mother and seven-year-old sister died two days apart wrote to Mr Collier in the 1970s about the impact of the disease.\n\n\"It caused quite a sensation having to have a double funeral on November 11th 1918, which was the very day the First World War ended,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I can remember very well when the cortege was on its way to the church. Bells, hooters and all sounds of celebration were raving but how silent people stood who realised it was our funeral.\n\n\"It really was a terrible time, not knowing who we were going to lose next.\"\n\nIn what was a cruel twist of fate, Spanish flu arrived on British shores just as soldiers were returning home from the horrors of war.\n\n\"You've got harrowing stories of soldiers who've survived the war... they're on their troop ship on their way home and they get a letter to say that their wife's died,\" said Ms Mawdsley, a PhD researcher at Queen Mary University of London.\n\n\"There was all this celebration, joy and relief at the end of the war that collides with death and grief.\" The young son of a Baptist minister in Leicester wrote of his father sleeping in the cemetery chapel while he conducted funerals from dawn until dusk.\n\nHe wanted to avoid taking the virus home to his wife and eight children - all of whom survived. They were the lucky ones: Leicester was hit especially hard with more people dying there in 1918 than there were babies born.\n\nAbout one in every four deaths in the city that year was attributed to influenza.\n\n\"The funeral corteges followed each other through the town,\" the man wrote to Collier on 19 May 1973.\n\n\"Often there was more than one coffin in a hearse. Graves were used to bury more than one person, especially when more than one of a household were victims at the same time.\" The letters describe Spanish flu's \"spectacular\" symptoms, said Ms Mawdsley.\n\n\"Some victims suffered something called heliotrope cyanosis which was kind of a creeping blue which started in your fingertips, tips of your ears and nose and lips but you could go completely black,\" she said.\n\n\"As it progressed you were more and more likely to die. Immediately after death the corpse would go completely black, which must have been very traumatic for loved ones to see.\"\n\nThe relentless processions of bodies through the streets was a sight a man from Stepney in east London could never forget.\n\n\"The undertakers couldn't make the coffins quick enough, let alone polish them,\" he wrote on 16 May 1973. \"The bodies changed colour so quickly after death they had to be screwed down to await burial.\n\n\"The gravediggers worked from dawn to dusk seven days a week to cope.

Recent research suggest the influenza may have started in the United States as early as 1916, and was brought over by US forces coming to fight in World War One the following year.\n\nWherever it started, the disease spread like wildfire amid unhygienic and confined conditions in trenches and training camps. News of the pandemic was suppressed in belligerent countries to avoid demoralising the population and offering a propaganda coup to the enemy.\n\nSo it was in neutral Spain where the first reports of the rampant influenza emerged, probably giving rise to the name Spanish flu or \"Spanish Lady\".\n\n\"It is truly a strange thing to come across a relative, executor or friend who is not sick with the flu or convalescing from it,\" reads an article in a May 1918 edition of Spain's ABC daily newspaper. Mr Ameal remembers inhaling vapours from cooked seaweed and eucalyptus leaves. He says those who were saved in Luarca owed much to a doctor called Don Ceferino, who visited the sick without charge.\n\nIn Luarca, the funeral processions went up the hill to the church of Santiago at Ribadecima.\n\nIt was abandoned shortly afterwards, amid fears the large number of flu victims buried there could cause a fresh epidemic.\n\nAround 500 people, a quarter of Luarca's population, died between 1918 and 1919.",

            "Text": "In the summer of 1978, the last known case of smallpox was reported, claiming the life of 40-year-old medical photographer Janet Parker. But how did the disease, thought to have been eradicated across the world, come to be in Britain's second city?\n\nIt was Friday 11 August when Janet Parker first began to feel unwell.\n\nWithin days, Mrs Parker, who worked in the anatomy department at Birmingham Medical School, had developed unsightly red spots on her back, limbs and face.\n\nWhen the doctor was called, she was told she had chickenpox.\n\nBut Mrs Parker's mother, Hilda Witcomb, was sceptical. She had nursed her daughter through the virus as a child, and the large blistering pustules now appearing on her body were markedly different.\n\nWith no signs of improvement, a hospital appointment was arranged and the 40-year-old was admitted to the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital in Solihull on 20 August. By now Mrs Parker was so weak she could not stand unaided.\n\n\"I do remember thinking she was very poorly, she had a very dramatic rash,\" said Prof Deborah Symmons, the first member of medical staff to see Mrs Parker when she was admitted.\n\n\"It was widely thought the last [smallpox] case had occurred.\"\n\nAs Prof Symmons examined Mrs Parker, it was only then the dreaded word \"variola\" - the scientific name for the disease - made it on to her medical notes for the first time, and soon the doctors' worst fears were confirmed.\n\nSmallpox, the last natural case of which anywhere in the world had been reported in Somalia in 1977, was back - in Birmingham. An ancient disease in existence for thousands of years, smallpox was feared throughout the world.\n\nKilling a third of those it infected, in the 20th Century alone an estimated 300 million people died from the disease.\n\nThose who were infected but survived were often left badly scarred.\n\nA global vaccination programme, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), was carried out to wipe out the disease and by the 1970s cases were rare.\n\nAnd in 1978 the body was just about to declare it eradicated on a worldwide level.\n\nThe last place anybody expected it to break out was in the UK, which had not seen an identified case of the disease for five years before Mrs Parker. The impact of its return was felt on a global scale. \"It was huge. Smallpox was about to be declared eradicated, people knew that was about to happen,\" said Prof Alasdair Geddes, who was a consultant in infectious disease at East Birmingham Hospital at the time of the outbreak.\n\n\"It was a feared disease; it wasn't just a panic in Birmingham, there was panic in the government and the WHO of it just reappearing.\"\n\nOn hearing of the Birmingham case, the WHO wasn't taking any chances. The organisation - and the media - descended on the city.\n\n\"Very very quickly, national and then international press appeared\" and it became a \"major worldwide issue\", said Prof Geddes.\n\n\"There was of course a heavy presence from the WHO. They were obviously very concerned.\n\n\"The incubation period for smallpox is quite long, it's about 12 days, so we had really about a fortnight's anxiety to whether there were going to be any more cases.\" As the medical teams jumped into action, those closest to Mrs Parker were among the first to be vaccinated and quarantined.\n\nHer husband, Joseph, and parents Hilda and Frederick Witcomb, were questioned about their recent movements, for fear the disease could spread further.\n\nAll those who had come into contact with Mrs Parker were treated similarly - from the man who came to fix the bedpan washer, ambulance staff, the hospital chaplain and the GPs who had seen her out in the community.\n\nBy 28 August, just two weeks after Mrs Parker had first shown symptoms of the disease, more than 500 people had been vaccinated.\n\nBut one question on everyone's mind remained: how had she been infected in the first place? Prof Henry Bedson headed the smallpox laboratory at Birmingham Medical School - where Mrs Parker worked - one of only a handful commissioned by the WHO to research the disease.\n\nProf Bedson joined Prof Geddes on the night Mrs Parker was diagnosed with the disease and helped examine her test samples.\n\n\"I said 'can you see anything Henry?', and he never answered,\" said Prof Geddes. \"So I gently moved his head aside so I could look down the microscope and there were brick-shaped particles that are characteristics of the smallpox virus.\n\n\"He was horrified, because there was little doubt that in some way the smallpox virus had escaped from his laboratory and had infected Mrs Parker.\"\n\n\"I think as soon as he saw it he knew somehow it had come from his lab. He knew what would follow,\" Prof Symmons said.\"Given the circumstances, where else could it have come from? One theory is that it got in the venting, but if that was the way, why only her?\"\n\nThe spotlight fell on Prof Bedson, says Prof Mark Pallen, author of The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham.\n\nAnd the 49-year-old professor, a recognised international expert on the disease, was left \"distraught\" by the outbreak.\n\n\"There was a media scrum, people were camped outside Bedson's house. He was working to rid the world of smallpox, he's a hero,\" Prof Pallen says.\n\nAs the days went on and Mrs Parker remained in isolation, her condition deteriorated.\n\nShe was left almost blind in both eyes from the sores and doctors believed she had gone into renal failure.",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nEarly identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\n\nMERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

            "Text": "WHO and colleagues from the University of Oxford, Imperial College London and Institut Pasteur* have estimated that, since 2016, 1 465 cases of Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and between 300 and 500 deaths may have been averted due to accelerated global efforts to detect infections early and reduce transmission.\n\nIn 2012, a novel virus that had not previously been seen in humans was identified for the first time in a resident from Saudi Arabia. The virus, now known as MERS-CoV, has, as of 31 May 2019, infected more than 2 442 people worldwide. MERS-CoV is a respiratory virus that can cause severe disease and has been fatal in approximately 35% of patients to date. MERS is zoonotic and people are infected from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. While the virus has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between people outside of hospitals, it has repeatedly caused large scale outbreaks in health care facilities with severe health, security and economic impacts, most notably in Saudi Arabia in 2014-2016 and the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015 involved 186 cases and 38 deaths, and had an estimated economic impact of US$12 billion.\n\nIn a research letter published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases on 8 July 2019, the researchers analyze case-based data on laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO since 2012. The total number of cases averted, when taking into account reduced camel-to-human and human-to-human transmission, was estimated at 507 (189\u2013967) in 2016, 507 (189\u2013967) in 2017, and 451 (191\u2013855) through September 2018, totaling 1,465 (895\u20132,165) cases averted and 293 (179\u2013433) expected deaths averted (under the assumption of a 20% CFR) from 2016 through September 2018. Assuming a 35.5% CFR, this estimate corresponds to 520 (318\u2013769) expected deaths averted.\n\nIn the letter, the authors write \u201cWe believe that affected countries are reducing the global threat of MERS through addressing knowledge gaps with regard to transmission, enhancing surveillance, and strengthening the ability to detect cases early and contain hospital outbreaks.\u201d The authors suggest that the reduction in cases has been achieved through improved infection prevention and control measures that are reducing human-to-human transmission. In addition, restriction of camel movement, stronger and more comprehensive investigations of cases and clusters at the time outbreaks are detected, and increased communication nationally and internationally have been critical in preventing international spread and sustained transmission.\n\nAlthough global efforts seem to have prevented hundreds of infections and deaths, vigilance and a sense of urgency to deal with this opportunistic infection must not be compromised. More needs to be done to understand MERS-CoV circulation in dromedaries and to limit spillover infections to humans. This will require stronger surveillance of dromedary populations and persons in direct contact with infected herds, coordination between animal and human sectors at the sub-national level and accelerated development of a vaccine for dromedaries. \"The international community and affected countries have a collective and shared responsibility to curtail a major health security threat such as MERS in the Middle East and beyond,\" the authors conclude.",

            "Text": "A new report from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health offers up a national strategy for expanding coronavirus antibody testing across the United States, and recommends that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lead a \"consistent, standardized effort\" to perform such testing nationwide.\n\nAntibody tests, also called serologic tests or serosurveys, look for evidence of an immune response to coronavirus infection and then use that evidence to determine if you have been infected with the virus in the past, even if you never developed symptoms or had an official diagnosis. A serosurvey then can show what proportion of the population has been previously infected.\n\nThe new report, published online Thursday and authored by eight experts affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, describes the value of serosurveys and provides recommendations for the US government and states on how to effectively perform these tests amid the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n\"The US government should take this opportunity to lead these serosurveys to ensure that resources are used efficiently, and the data collected can be used to improve the public health of Americans in the future,\" the researchers wrote in the report.\nThe report acknowledged that \"budget must be carefully considered\" when designing serosurveys, which can be expensive -- possibly costing up to millions of dollars, depending on the size, cost of tests and storing samples, among other factors. Serosurveys for the common flu can cost about $3.53 million for one project, for example, and surveillance studies for HIV can cost about $708,000 for one project, according to the report.\n\nThe report also noted that once serosurveys are conducted, the US government should create a central repository or database for the new data being collected to reside -- and the CDC could lead the way in designing the serosurveys and their protocols.\n\n\"A central repository, similar to that found in ClinicalTrials.gov, would be a valuable resource to include all serosurveys, including their methodology, timelines, and purpose. A systematic method of entering data on serosurveys would then allow studies to be easily compared and could also allow individuals to access serosurveys in their area,\" the researchers wrote in the report. \"Right now, states are designing and initiating their own studies, but having a consistent protocol for carrying out serosurveys would make findings more valuable.\"\n\nThe report added that employers and universities using antibody tests \"should be strongly encouraged to register their studies\" in that central repository.\n\nThe report also emphasized that validating serological tests remains critical for ensuring that tests are indeed producing accurate results. In early May, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that the National Cancer Institute would be helping to validate antibody tests on the market -- yet no results from those validation studies so far have been made public, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The report says, \"The FDA, NIH, CDC, and NCI should release the results of their antibody test validation study.\"\n\nOverall, the researchers wrote that \"serosurveys can generate valuable data on the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that can better inform public health decisions at a population level",

Experts are especially worried about gyms; it's hard to maintain social distancing in close, sweaty quarters, and research has demonstrated that workout classes can be major sources of spread.\n\nAt Inspire South Bay Fitness in Redondo, California, owner Peet Sapsin knew he had to get creative for his clients to feel safe coming back in the door.\nIn addition to cutting class sizes, Sapsin and his wife have created individual plastic workout pods for people to take classes while still maintaining social distance.\nInitially, Sapsin told CNN, the gym considered mandating masks for returning clients. \"We tested it out on Zoom, though, and could tell that people couldn't breathe. We felt really bad for them. Our clients are like our family. We were thinking, how do we want our family to feel?\" After ruling out mandatory masks, he explained, the pods were born. \"My wife drew them out on paper, and soon after, we built our first prototype,\" Sapsin said. The pods are constructed from shower curtains and PVC pipes, a more cost-effective alternative to plexiglass. Overall, he said, the project cost less than $400. \"We sent the prototype to our clients, and they were very excited, and felt more comfortable knowing there was a clear wall between one person and the next,\" he said. The pods are about 6 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Sapsin and his team are not the only business owners who have had to think creatively in the wake of Covid-19. Other close-contact business like nail salons, tattoo parlors, and barber shops have also come up with ways to maintain distance. Some restaurants are using stained glass walls and strategically placed plants to keep diners safe. In Amsterdam, a restaurant built individual greenhouses to separate guests.\nSapsin and his team are also cleaning their studio daily, and keeping the fans running and doors open to circulate air. Additionally, with the pods, clients no longer need to rotate throughout the room. \"Everything you need is inside your pod -- bench, mat, dumbbells. There is also a disinfecting spray in there, so that after, everyone can clean up after themselves,\" Sapsin said.\nCalifornia allowed for schools, gyms, movie theaters, and bars to reopen with modifications on June 12.\nThe reopening came after California reported nearly its highest single-day total of confirmed new cases of the coronavirus, with more than 3,000 new infections.\nSo far, Sapsin said, the reception to the pods has been incredibly positive. \"We've maxed out our morning and evening classes, and within our community, everyone is super exited and appreciative that we are trying to keep them a little bit safer.\"\nJustin Arevalo, who has been teaching classes at Inspire South Bay Fitness for two years, told CNN that when he first heard of the pods, \"I thought it was really funny.

They're in denial,\" one administration official close to the coronavirus task force said.\nOthers close to the President say he his not in denial but instead is focused on putting Americans back to work and providing optimism after a dark period for the country. The President's focus in meetings over the past several weeks has been on economic figures and developing a vaccine -- not the increase in cases -- according to people familiar with the matter. Trump has also begun to question the accuracy of numbers from states and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing case counts increasing in certain areas, one person familiar with the matter said. Trump has previously questioned data coming from governors and the nation's top health agency.\nEven as the virus continues to spread, Trump has stated clearly he is ready to move past the pandemic. He will resume campaigning on Saturday with an indoor rally in Oklahoma that's expected to draw a massive crowd, causing alarm among some top public health experts. He has encouraged governors to lift restrictions put in place to prevent contagion. And he has sidelined the coronavirus task force that once met daily to coordinate the federal government's response to the crisis.\nYet the virus has shown an unwillingness to subside. Florida, Texas and Arizona set daily records for new cases this week. The states are among 21 across the nation seeing increasing trends in new cases from one week to the next. Outside the United States, the coronavirus has caused new lockdowns in Beijing. In wide-ranging meetings at the White House over the past several days, Trump has not focused intently on the coronavirus, a shift from the height of the pandemic when the President spent more time hearing from administration experts and honing his messaging with aides, according to officials. The White House coronavirus task force has also met with less frequency.\nWhen the topic does arise, Trump has asked for updates that might show the economy recovering after the pandemic-related downturn and has pressed advisers to speed up the process of finding a vaccine, potentially before the end of the year.\nTrump has shown less interest in hearing data from individual states and cities where case counts have increased, and has repeated behind closed doors that a ramped-up testing regime was leading to more cases being identified. He has also suggested, without detailing his reasoning, that some states may be providing inaccurate figures that show cases increasing.\n\"If we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any,\" Trump said Monday during a meeting highlighting the administration's efforts to help senior citizens.\nAs Trump moves ahead with a planned campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday, some public health experts are warning it is too soon to hold a large gathering in the state. Oklahoma's number of newly reported positive cases has been increasing since late May. A record 225 new cases were reported there on Saturday. On Sunday, that number declined to 158 new cases and went back up to 186 on Monday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health.\n\"I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn't as large a concern as it is today,\" the director of the Tulsa Health Department, Bruce Dart, said in an interview with the Tulsa World.\nThe Trump campaign has said it will take the temperature of attendees and provide hand sanitizer and masks during the event. But wearing masks won't be required, and Trump himself has signaled that mask-wearing is an optional step that he has refused to take himself in public.\nTrump is \"very excited to get back on the road and connect directly with people,\" his counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \"I'm sure there are those who will never want to do that again because obviously that is the gold standard and his stock and trade for him.\"",

            "Text": "As cases rise in 20 states around the United States, pockets of student-athletes retuning to campus have tested positive, underscoring the difficulty colleges and professional sports leagues face as they prepare for the possibility of a fall sports season.\n\nThe University of Texas, where football players began voluntary workouts this week, said Thursday that 13 players had tested positive, and another 10 were self-quarantining after officials carried out contact tracing. Last week, the University of Houston suspended voluntary workouts for its athletes after six of them tested positive. And at Southern Methodist University, officials said this week that five of 75 athletes tested were positive.\n\nAt least eight Kansas State University athletes tested positive for the virus since returning to campus, officials said this week. The university\u2019s athletic director said that they had anticipated a \u201csmall number\u201d of positive tests. University officials said athletes were being asked to quarantine for seven days after arriving on campus and were not being allowed to practice until they tested negative.\n\nMany of the athletes who tested positive were asymptomatic, according to their universities. As students return to campus, they risk bringing the virus with them and seeding outbreaks in parts of the country with relatively few cases. Some fall games can usually attract about 100,000 fans. \u201cUnless players are essentially in a bubble \u2014 insulated from the community and they are tested nearly every day \u2014 it would be very hard to see how football is able to be played this fall,\u201d Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,  the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert said Thursday on CNN. \u201cIf there is a second wave, which is certainly a possibility and which would be complicated by the predictable flu season, football may not happen this year.\u201d\n\nAt least four Division I games have already been canceled. On Thursday, the Atlantic Coast Conference said that it would move its annual kickoff event to a virtual format, following similar decisions by the Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences. In the professional sports world, no leagues have regular-season games on any public schedules. Because of precautions, there are few solid plans to include fans. And the N.F.L. slate could be in some jeopardy as teams are unsure about the start of training camps in July.\n\nMajor League Baseball may not happen either. For weeks, team owners and players have not been able to agree on how to stage a shortened season, creating the possibility of no baseball season for the first time in 150 years.\n\nThe N.B.A. wants to quarantine teams in Florida to finish its season in August and perform a two-month postseason beyond that, though some players are balking at such confinement. The N.H.L. has similar ideas, but nothing is truly scheduled. There are some glints of optimism. Professional golf, NASCAR and combat sports have returned \u2014 and tennis is expected to resume in August \u2014 though more as made-for-TV events than as anything resembling a collective experience. NASCAR will hold a race in Alabama this weekend, but attendance will be limited to 5,000 fans.",

Not all the unemployment claims reported on Thursday necessarily reflect new layoffs. Some states are still working through backlogs of claims filed earlier in the pandemic, and in other cases people filing under multiple programs may be counted twice.\n\nYet there is little doubt that layoffs remain elevated, and economists say that job losses could worsen if government support that has helped prop up the economy is allowed to lapse too soon.\n\nStocks have been unsteady for the past week, as investors weighed concerns about a rise in new cases around the world against the prospects for an economic recovery.

Still, he said that city and state officials had been encouraged by \u201cthe trend line\u201d of test results and hospitalizations, which have stayed flat in recent weeks, and decided to allow the reopening to go forward.\n\nThe mayor said that the city\u2019s playgrounds, which have been shut since March, would also reopen on Monday.

Health officials said 40 of the cases were employees or park patrons, while 18 of the cases were secondary infections. The new numbers include two cases in Marin County, near San Francisco, where one parent of a 6-year-old has asked school officials to bar any children who have not been vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). \"Fortunately, there is no need to exclude any students from a Marin County school at this time as there is no evidence for school-based exposure,\" the county public health office said in a statement.\nThe two measles patients are siblings, both of whom are unvaccinated. Their cases are related to the outbreak at Disneyland.\nCNN affiliate KGO reported the children aren't going to school and aren't in the county.\nThe health department said 63% of the people with measles are more than 20 years old. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\nOpinion: Why I won't let unvaccinated people around my kids\nThe disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said.\nMeasles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, which means it is no longer native to the United States but continues to be brought in by international travelers.\nArizona measles exposure worries parents of at-risk kids\nLast year, the United States had its most number of measles cases -- at 644 -- since 2000, the CDC says on its website.\nIn the first 28 days of January alone, 84 measles cases were reported in 14 states, including California, according to the CDC. The larger California statistic that the state released Friday encompasses December and January.\nNew cases are being reported regularly, as are public notices for those who might have interacted with infected people.\nFor example, the New York state health department on Friday announced a new measles case in Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, which is 100 miles north of New York City. The infected student rode Amtrak train No. 283 from New York City's Penn Station, a train that went to Albany and eventually to Niagara Falls.\nThe CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel.",

Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated.\n\"Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,\" Smith said. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990.\nThe outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20.\nHealth officials said on a conference call Friday that while the Disney-related outbreak is over, another surge of cases could occur if someone with measles visits the state, given the high number of foreign tourists and people in the state who are not vaccinated.\nCalifornia allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and \"personal beliefs.\" There were about 1,000 medical exemptions in the state during the 2013-2014 school year, and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions.\nMeasles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.\nWhile once widespread in the United States, cases dropped significantly because of vaccines. In 2000, health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States, which meant it was no longer native but continued to be brought in by international travelers.",

Philippines is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation.\nAll the affected counties, plus a neighboring county, are offering measles vaccine clinics to help those who want to get vaccinated. Amado said those in the Amish community who have declined to be vaccinated are being asked to try to quarantine themselves at home to reduce the spread of the disease.\nThere have been 15 measles outbreaks in the United States so far during 2014.\n\"This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,\" Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail.\nTen years ago there were 37 measles cases in the United States, the lowest number since 2000, when the disease was considered eliminated in this country.

Tim Murphy (R-Pennsylvania), the subcommittee's chairman, asked the panel of public health officials as his first question.\nAll four public health panelists were quick to agree.\n\"Vaccines save lives and are the best way for parents to protect their children from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\nAnd the four medical experts quickly asserted that there is no known link between vaccines and autism, a connection that has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The panelists called the vaccine \"very safe.\"\nThe vaccination controversy erupted after news of a measles outbreak went national. The outbreak spread from Disneyland in California to 14 states, where there are now 102 cases of measles -- a disease that was thought to be eradicated in the U.S.\nThe majority of people affected by the outbreak had not been vaccinated, Schuchat said.\nMeasles outbreak: How bad is it?\nJust a day earlier, libertarian Sen. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist from Kentucky, suggested that he has heard of \"many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines\" and said parents should have some choice in deciding whether to vaccinate their children.\nThe four panelists said there is no credible evidence to back up Paul's claims that vaccines can cause \"profound mental disorders,\" when prompted by Rep. Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also suggested that while he had his own children vaccinated, parent's \"need to have some measure of choice.\" Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts later clarified that Christie believes governors should have jurisdiction over vaccination requirements.\nRepublican Rep. Michael Burgess, a physician from Texas, called out those claims during the subcommittee hearing Tuesday, calling the injection of the vaccination issue into presidential politics \"inappropriate.\"\n\"It is important for parents to have their children vaccinated,\" Burgess said, recalling his experience with measles as a child, when the vaccine didn't exist.\n\"I remember the measles. It was bad. Hard shaking chills doesn't even begin to describe it,\" Burgess said. \"It is a different disease and we've forgotten about it quite frankly because you never see it.\"\nThere is no federal law mandating vaccinations in the U.S. Children are required to be vaccinated against certain diseases to enter public schools, though the requirements vary by state.\nAll 50 states have some type of vaccine requirement, according to the CDC.\nBurgess said the states should continue to have jurisdiction over vaccinations, but the absence of a federal mandate doesn't minimize the importance of vaccines.\nDifferent states, different rules on vaccinations\nAnother potential 2016 contender, Texas' Sen. Ted Cruz, told reporters \"children of course should be vaccinated\" and even defended his potential 2016 opponent for the GOP nomination.\n\"This issue is largely silliness stirred up by the media,\" Cruz said. \"Nobody reasonably thinks Chris Christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines.\"\nCruz added in a statement that vaccines \"have tremendous public health benefits.\"\n\"But on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated, the answer is obvious, and there's widespread agreement: of course they should. We vaccinate both our girls, and encourage all parents to do the same,\" Cruz said.\nSen. Marco Rubio, who is also considering a 2016 run, was unequivocal: children should \"absolutely\" be vaccinated and the practice should \"absolutely\" be mandatory, he said Tuesday.\nRubio added to the heap of doctors and experts who assert there is no link between vaccinations.\nAnd unvaccinated people, Rubio added, put infants at risk.\n\"If enough people are not vaccinated you put at risk infants that are three months of age or younger that have not been vaccinated, and you put at risk immune-suppressed children that are not able to get those vaccinations,\" Rubio said. \"So absolutely, all children in America [should be vaccinated].\"",

In 2011, there were 222 cases.\nAs of November, there have been 175 cases reported, according to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden. The elimination declaration means measles no longer spreads year-round in the country, the CDC says. But it is still common throughout the world.\nOf this year's cases, 172 were import-associated, meaning they were brought into the country from overseas, according to a paper published Thursday in JAMA Pediatrics. The other three were likely directly imported.\nU.S. measles cases in 2013 may be most in 17 years\nHere are 5 things to know about measles:\nMeasles is caused by a virus\nThe measles virus normally grows in the cells lining the back of the throat and lungs, according to the CDC. It causes fever, runny nose, cough and a blotchy rash over the entire body. Other symptoms include red, watery eyes, body aches and tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth.\nA typical case begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and sore throat. Two or three days after symptoms begin, the white spots may appear in the mouth, the CDC says. A red or reddish-brown body rash begins three to five days after symptoms appear. It usually begins at the hairline on the face and spreads downward. A person's fever may spike as high as 104 degrees when the rash appears.\nMeasles can be fatal\nAbout one in 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection; up to one in 20 gets pneumonia; about one out of 1,000 gets encephalitis; and one or two out of 1,000 die, according to the CDC. It can also make a pregnant woman miscarry or give birth prematurely.\nMeasles kills an estimated 164,000 people around the world yearly, and there are an estimated 20 million cases worldwide. More than half of the deaths occur in India, according to federal health officials.\nBefore the measles vaccine was introduced, nearly all children got measles by the time they reached the age of 15. Each year in the United States, about 450 to 500 people died from measles; 48,000 were hospitalized; 7,000 had seizures; and about 1,000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness, according to the CDC.\nMeasles is highly contagious\nMeasles can be spread from four days before a rash appears to four days afterward. It is so contagious, in fact, the CDC says 90% of people who are not immune and are close to someone with measles will also become infected.\nThe virus spreads through the air when an affected person sneezes or coughs. The droplets get into people's noses or throats through breathing or when someone puts their fingers in their mouth after touching an infected surface. The virus can live on infected surfaces for up to two hours.\nIf you've already had measles, you can't get it again, because your body has built up immunity to the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe measles vaccine does not cause autism\nThe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was licensed in 1971 to protect against all three diseases. Nearly 10 million doses of the MMR vaccine are distributed each year in the United States. The CDC recommends two doses: One at 12-15 months of age and a second at 4-6 years of age. This means that babies are not immune, and can contract the measles from unvaccinated people.\nIn 2010, the medical journal The Lancet retracted a controversial 1998 paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The study had been discredited, and its author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was found to have acted unethically in conducting the research.\nWakefield, in a statement at the time, denied wrongdoing.",

            "Text": "A measles outbreak has hit an isolated Amazon tribe, the Yanomami, on the border of Venezuela and Brazil, according to Survival International, a nongovernmental organization that works to protect tribal peoples.\n\nThe outbreak has put 23 tribe members in the hospital and is threatening hundreds more.\n\"Any remote indigenous people with little contact with mainstream society have low resistance to diseases that are introduced from outsiders,\" said Sarah Shenker, a senior researcher at Survival International.\n\"That's why this epidemic of measles that has broken out on the Venezuela-Brazil border in recent months is particularly worrying for the Yanomami and could be catastrophic. It could wipe out whole communities.\" The nongovernmental organization Watinaba, which defends the rights of various Amazon indigenous groups in Venezuela, tweeted about the measles outbreak on Thursday, showing various Yanomami who have contracted measles and asking for vaccinations for the tribespeople. Measles is a highly infectious -- and potentially fatal -- viral illness that is typically spread from person to person by breathing or coughing. Symptoms include a runny nose, high fever, eye inflammation and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Complications such as blindness, brain inflammation and even death can occur in approximately 30% of cases, according to the World Health Organization. In 2016, WHO declared Brazil, along with the rest of the Americas, free of measles. However, between January and late May, there were 995 reported cases in Brazil, according to WHO.\nAccording to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Venezuelans crossing the border have brought measles into Brazil. All 995 reported measles cases were in the border states of Amazonas and Roraima.\nThe ongoing economic and political crisis in Venezuela, which has spawned a massive shortage of medicine and vaccines, caused measles to return to the country in 2017, according to a report by the International Crisis Group. Since July 2017, there have been 2,150 confirmed cases of measles in Venezuela. But the the arrival of illegal gold miners -- probably from Venezuela -- in Yanomami territory coincided with tribal members contracting the disease, said Shenker, who believes they are to blame.\nBrazilian authorities have deployed medical teams to the region as well as 711,400 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health.\nBut the Yanomami remain at particular risk given their low immunity to diseases and the difficulty in reaching those who may need the vaccine, Shenker said.\nThe Yanomami make up the largest semi-isolated tribe in South America, whose territory spans the jungles and mountains of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela. During the 1980s, over 40,000 gold miners entered their territory, shooting tribespeople, destroying their villages and exposing them to disease, according to Survival International. The Yanomami lost 20% of their population during these incursions.\nToday, it's estimated that 35,000 Yanomami remain. Although a large portion of today's Yanomami population has had at least some contact with outsiders, there are still groupings and villages that have never been exposed. And for this particular subpopulation, even contact with medical experts is dangerous, putting them at risk of contracting outside illnesses, Shenker said.\nRepresentatives of the Yanomami have approached authorities in Venezuela asking for help and vaccinations, said Luis Bello, a lawyer for Watinaba.\nDespite the availability of a vaccine, measles remains a significant driver of death among children around the globe. In 2016, measles caused the deaths of almost 90,000 people -- predominantly children under the age of 5.\nThe MMR vaccine is typically given in two doses in early childhood. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if the person is exposed to the virus, while two doses are about 97% effective, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccinating the Yanomami against measles is an important first step in protecting those tribal people who have had contact with outsiders. However, more long-term solutions are necessary to protect the Yanomami from diseases like measles -- and people who bring those diseases -- which threaten their existence, according to Shenker.\n\"We need to protect their land. That is the only feasible long-term solution to prevent such potentially disastrous epidemics from reaching the Yanomami and other tribes is by protecting their land.\"",

            "Text": "Germany's parliament has voted to make measles vaccinations compulsory for children, with parents who fail to immunize their children facing fines of \u20ac2,500 ($2,750).\n\nThe Measles Protection Act, which the Bundestag approved on Thursday, requires all parents to provide evidence that their child has received two measles vaccinations before they are enrolled in school or kindergarten.\nMedical staff, daycare workers, teachers and workers at community facilities must also be vaccinated under the act, which is due to come into effect in March 2020, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health told CNN. There has been a resurgence of measles -- a highly infectious viral illness that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes -- across the globe. Symptoms of the illness -- which can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces -- may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots.\nGermany had registered 501 measles cases between January and mid-October 2019, according to the Ministry of Health.\nUnder the new law, parents will have to present a certificate to the educational institution proving their child has received both vaccinations. Parents who do not inoculate their children will face a fine of \u20ac2,500.\nDaycare centers that admit unvaccinated children will also be charged, and children who are not vaccinated can be excluded from school, according to the ministry. Measles has seen a wide resurgence around the world -- in both high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency.\nAlmost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally in 2018, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF -- more than doubling from 2017.\nTwo doses of the vaccine are needed to protect against measles. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine to ensure herd immunity.\nAccording to the German Ministry of Health, although 97.1% of first-graders had received the first vaccination, rates are not as high for the second jab, meaning the country still hasn't reached the 95% quota.",

Nine stem from a KinderCare Learning Center location in Palatine, a Chicago suburb. One case in Chicago is not related to that day care facility. Measles is a serious and highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads when a person breathes, coughs or sneezes and droplets travel through the air. The disease is especially dangerous for infants, who cannot receive vaccines until they are at least 6 months old. Young children are particularly vulnerable in cases in which they have received only one dose of measles vaccine.\nSymptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, tiny white spots on the inner lining of the cheek and a rash with tiny red spots that starts at the head and spreads. Though there's no cure for measles, it can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective, according to medical professionals.\nGeorgia confirmed Monday its first confirmed case of measles since 2012.\nAn infected infant arrived in Atlanta from outside of the United States. Health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine where that patient might have contracted the disease. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but a recent outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in California.\nAs of February 6, there are 121 cases of measles in 17 states and Washington, D.C., the CDC said.\nThere are 88 cases in California, and 103 cases nationwide are linked to the Disneyland outbreak. The state with the second-highest number of measles cases is Arizona, which has seven, the CDC reports. Illinois has three, and Washington has four. The other places reporting one or more cases are Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Utah.",

            "Text": "The number of people infected with measles in the European region in 2018 is the highest in a decade, the World Health Organization said Thursday.\n\nAccording to newly released data for the year, 82,596 people were infected and 72 people (children and adults) died from measles last year. Sixty-one percent of those infected were hospitalized, according to the report. The number of cases reported is \"the highest this decade,\" WHO said in a statement, noting that the numbers are \"3 times the total reported in 2017 and 15 times the record low number of people affected in 2016.\" The illnesses in 2018 were reported in 47 of the 53 countries that make up the WHO European region.\nNinety-two percent of the cases were reported by 10 countries: Ukraine (53,218), Serbia (5,076), Israel (2,919), France (2,913), Italy (2,517), Russia (2,256), Georgia (2,203), Greece (2,193), Albania (1,466) and Romania (1,987).\nThe United States is experiencing measles outbreaks in New York state, New York City and Washington state, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said began when travelers to Israel and the Ukraine returned to the US infected.\n\"The strain D8 in Washington's outbreak matches the strain from an ongoing Eastern European outbreak. This is consistent with testing from the first known case (a child) from this outbreak in WA. All of our cases match this strain,\" the Washington State Department of Health said in an email. Measles is a contagious virus that spreads through the air via coughing and sneezing. Symptoms such as high fever, rash all over the body, stuffy nose and reddened eyes typically disappear without treatment within two or three weeks. Yet one or two out of every 1,000 children who get measles will die from complications, according to the CDC.\nThe new report also found that more children in the region were vaccinated than ever before, although the total number of vaccinations was not readily available. Of note, 2017 was also a record year for vaccination coverage when 90% of coverage for the second dose of the measles vaccine was achieved for the first time ever, according to WHO. \"The picture for 2018 makes it clear that the current pace of progress in raising immunization rates will be insufficient to stop measles circulation. While data indicate exceptionally high immunization coverage at regional level, they also reflect a record number affected and killed by the disease. This means that gaps at [the] local level still offer an open door to the virus,\" Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO regional director for Europe, said in a statement.\nThe agency said it will continue working to improve vaccination rates. \"We cannot achieve healthier populations globally, as promised in WHO's vision for the coming five years, if we do not work locally. We must do more and do it better to protect each and every person from diseases that can be easily avoided,\" Jakab said.",

We'd rather invest in preventing disease than spend funds fighting it. We want to focus on promoting health in those instances where we can rather than fighting disease.\"\nSince the outbreak, at least 8,250 people have been exposed to the measles virus in Minnesota, mostly in schools, child-care settings or health-care settings, and there have been 21 hospitalizations, Ehresmann said. \"When we talk about an exposure to measles, we're really talking about any time people have shared air space,\" Ehresmann said. \"Just sharing air space is sufficient to transmit the virus. ... It's transmitted via the respiratory route.\"\nMeasles is highly contagious since it can spread through the air when you cough or sneeze. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and rash. The infectious disease can lead to pneumonia, hospitalizations or even death.\nTwo vaccines prevent measles: the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, which is available to children. \"Measles is a dangerous and vaccine-preventable disease. There is no reason to decline MMR unless the individual is too young to be vaccinated or has a severe immunodeficiency and they cannot be vaccinated,\" said Patricia Stinchfield, director of infection prevention and control for Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.\n\"The reason we vaccinate is because of the potential for infection of the brain or lungs that can cause permanent and lasting damage. Death from measles is one to two per 1,000 cases because there is no antiviral medicine against measles. All we can do is provide IV fluids, oxygen and support and hope they survive,\" she said.\n\"The best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated with MMR on schedule. Do not listen to false messages from anti-vaccine groups, and know that to decline vaccination is to put your child at risk.\"\nThe United States declared in 2000 that measles was eliminated nationwide, but cases can still occur if travelers become infected with the measles virus in another country and then bring the virus into the US. Measles remains common in many other parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa, according to the CDC.",

Kennedy International Airport in New York to Tel Aviv, according to El Al airline, her employer. She developed a fever March 31 and then slipped into a coma about a week later. She was diagnosed with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, a complication of measles.\n\"El Al mourns the death of a member of the airline's flight crew.

About 1 out of every 1,000 children who gets measles will develop encephalitis, according to the CDC. This can lead to convulsions and leave a child deaf or with an intellectual disability.\nAdditionally, 1 or 2 out of 1,000 US children who get measles will die from it. Worldwide, the illness is fatal in 1 or 2 out of every 100 children.\nBefore the measles vaccine was introduced in the early 1960s, an estimated 400 to 500 people in the United States died of the disease each year, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 developed encephalitis, according to the CDC.",

It was considered eradicated in the United States in 2000, though 2014 saw a record-breaking number of confirmed cases: 610 according to the Centers for Disease Control, \"the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000,\" the CDC says on its website.\nNevertheless, California health officials speculate that since Disneyland attracts visitors from around the world -- including places where the highly contagious disease is prevalent -- that was likely the case here.\n\"Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles,\" read a statement from California Department of Public Health. \"Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.\"\nDr. Pamela Hymel, Disney's chief medical officer, issued a brief statement: \"We are working with the health department to provide any information and assistance we can.\"\nAs for symptoms, \"measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat,\" according to the CDC.\nThose showing such symptoms shouldn't be bashful about seeing their doctor, because a full body rash is likely to break out next. \"If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your health care provider,\" said Dr. Ron Chapman, California's state health office.\nChapman says prevention is the key: \"The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated.\"",

The announcement comes as measles cases in the United States have surpassed the highest number on record since the disease was declared eliminated nationwide in 2000.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the milestone Wednesday, saying that it has counted 695 cases in 22 states this year. With outbreaks spreading, President Donald Trump on Friday stressed the need for Americans to get vaccinated.\n\"The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now,\" Trump said. \"They have to get their shots.\" The statement from health officials in Los Angeles said the measures were implemented \"to build awareness among students, faculty and staff about the risks of measles after a potential exposure to measles.\"\n\"Quarantine for measles can be up to 21 days from the date of last exposure, at which time the exposed person is no longer a risk for developing the disease and spreading measles to others,\" the statement said.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or if someone comes into direct contact or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots.\nMeasles can stay in the air for up to two hours after a sick person coughs or sneezes and can stay on surfaces for many hours, making a college campus especially susceptible for the disease to spread due to the high volume of people going into and out of buildings.",

Inter-country variations in rates of immunization -- such as in Germany, the UK, Italy, and France -- are worrying for experts.\"If the coverage dips below [95%] in certain regions, measles cases can spread and outbreaks can and are occurring,\" said Dr. Pauline Paterson, co-director of the Vaccine Confidence team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\"While most people vaccinate, some individuals do not.

At the same time, local anti-vaccination activists started to hold meetings in the community, he said.\n\"So, by about 2008, we started to see the vaccine rates drop as the word got through the Somali community that autism was linked to measles vaccination,\" he said. \"In the years since then, Andrew Wakefield has actually been brought in several times to the Somali community here in Minnesota to actually give presentations supporting this information. ... His work has been retracted.\"\nThree years later, a University of Minnesota research project investigated whether there was a higher prevalence of autism in Somali children who live in Minneapolis versus non-Somali children in Minneapolis. The project included data on children who were 7 to 9 years old in 2010.\nThe researchers found Somali and white children in Minneapolis to be equally likely to be identified with autism, and both groups were more likely to be identified with autism than non-Somali black and Hispanic children.\nMeanwhile, a precipitous dropoff in vaccination coverage still continued among children of Somali descent, Ehresmann said. Osterholm said that a measles outbreak hit the Somali community in Minnesota in 2011. Though it was smaller than the current outbreak, it was largely associated with children not being vaccinated, he said.\n\"Measles finds unvaccinated people, and this outbreak has two key points,\" Ehresmann said. \"One is the effect of targeted misinformation on a vulnerable community, but the other is that if you're not vaccinated, you are vulnerable.\"",

Folks who received that vaccine, or who were vaccinated during those years and aren't sure which one they got, should get vaccinated anew, the CDC says.\nBut if you've had one documented dose of the effective \"live\" vaccine and aren't at high risk of exposure, the agency says that's adequate.\nThose at higher risk -- whom the agency advises to get two doses for good measure -- might work in health care, travel internationally or be more likely to be affected by an outbreak.",

But what if you don't have written documentation of the right vaccine? For anyone who's unsure, the CDC says you can simply roll up your sleeve for another dose or two.\n\"The MMR vaccine is safe, and there is no harm in getting another dose,\" the agency says.\nThere is also a blood test doctors can use to check immunity. Though some experts say it's impractical or expensive for the general population, versus simply getting another shot.\nSome people can't get vaccinated at all or need to wait: for example, people with weakened immune systems and babies who are too young to respond to the vaccine.",

            "Text": "Parents at a Chicago-area day care center are keeping a close watch over their children for any signs of fever or rashes. They learned Wednesday that two infants who attend a KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois, have tested positive for measles.\n\nThree more cases have been diagnosed, based on clinical and other criteria, but results are pending, according to a statement from the Cook County Department of Public Health and state officials.\nOfficials say it is not clear whether these cases are linked to a previously confirmed case in suburban Cook County or to the outbreak associated with Disneyland in California.\nIn light of the ongoing debate over childhood vaccinations, agencies are taking extra precautions to limit the spread of the measles.\nEveryone at the day care center was notified about the measles cases. Anyone who has not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine was told to stay at home and away from others who have not been vaccinated for the next 21 days. Infected people are contagious from four days before their rash begins through four days afterward.\nKinderCare issued a statement, saying it is focused on ensuring the continued health and safety of everyone at the center.\nIn addition to banning children and staff who have not been vaccinated and may have been exposed to the measles until February, 24, KinderCare says the Palatine center also received a deep cleaning. Officials promised to closely monitor the situation and to keep families informed.\nThe two infants confirmed to have measles have not been vaccinated. Amy Poore-Terrell, spokeswoman for the public health department, says the children were too young to be vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is generally not given to children under the age of 1.\nOfficials are advising anyone who experiences a high fever and rash to call their local health department and their doctor, even though the cases appear to be concentrated in the northwest suburban Cook County region.\nMeasles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications including pneumonia and encephalitis.\nMeasles is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.",

            "Text": "At least 314 cases of measles have been reported in the United States since January 1, according to national numbers shared Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat's 46 more than the number reported by the agency last week and includes illnesses reported by state health departments to the CDC through March 21.\nThis year's number is 58 shy of the 372 cases reported in all of 2018, the second-highest number in more than two decades. CDC spokesman Jason McDonald wrote in an email that the agency does not \"try and predict how many cases we will have in any particular year or when we might surpass the number of cases that occurred in a previous year.\" Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory illness characterized by a rash of flat red spots. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes.\nThe disease was eliminated in the United States in 2000 but is endemic in many other countries. It is brought in when people who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated visit from a place where the virus is circulating or when people living in the United States visit such a place and return with an infection.\nHealth officials have said that the proliferation of anti-vaccine rhetoric has, in part, fueled an increase in the number of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States.\nRecent outbreaks of measles have occurred in some states that are more permissive in allowing parents to get waivers for their children to attend school without being vaccinated. Measles cases this year have been reported in 15 states, the same number as last week: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\nAs of Thursday, there were seven cases reported in California, according to the state department of health. Also as of Thursday, Texas health officials reported 14 cases of measles.\nAs of Friday, health officials confirmed eight cases in Oakland County, Michigan, all in the past two weeks. New Jersey health officials also reported eight cases as of Friday.\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services reported a case of measles in a 12-month-old on March 8 and has not reported additional cases since then.\nWashington state has reported 78 cases in an outbreak that began in January, one more case than what was reported last week. That includes individuals in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Georgia who all became infected in Washington. (Hawaii is not included on the CDC list of states reporting cases because the cases there were reported by Washington.)\nOregon has also reported six other cases that are not linked to that outbreak. New York has reported at least 342 cases since October in an ongoing outbreak in Brooklyn and Rockland County. At least 23 of the Brooklyn cases were reported as of March 19; four new cases were reported in Rockland County as of Thursday.\nConnecticut reported at least two cases of measles last month but has not reported additional cases since. Kentucky also reported one case in February and none since then. As of February 27, Colorado had one case of the illness. Georgia reported three cases in January and has had no new cases since then. Illinois reported six cases, which is unchanged since last week. New Hampshire reported a case in March 1.\n\"We will continue to monitor the outbreaks and report weekly the number of cases in the United States,\" McDonald said.",

            "Text": "The day after celebrating his 5 month birthday, Walter Blum spiked a fever of 102.5.\n\n\"It's terrifying,\" his mother, Sara Blum, said. \"You see it and you're like, OK, that's really high.\"\nThen a rash covered him head to toe.\n\"It was all over his face. All over the back of his neck. It was really red and splotchy,\" said Blum, who lives in California. \"It was very alarming.\"\nThe diagnosis: measles.\nLike 92 other children infected with measles in the United States this year, Walter was too young to be vaccinated against the highly contagious, vaccine-preventable virus.\nLike all babies, he relied on the rest of society to vaccinate. Walter Blum was 5 months old when he developed measles.\n\"It's really sad, but our community kind of failed us,\" Blum said.\nOn a call with reporters on Monday, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized that point. \"When you get vaccinated you protect others around you at risk for complications.\"\nThe CDC said Monday there have been 704 cases of measles nationwide this year as of Friday. Seventy-one percent (503) of this year's US patients were unvaccinated, 11% (76) were vaccinated with at least one of the recommended doses, and 18% (125) had an unknown vaccination status. Of those infected this year, 25 were younger than 6 months old, 68 were between 6 and 11 months old and 167 were between 16 months and 4 years old.\nThe new case total is nine more than the agency reported Wednesday when it confirmed that the United States had reached the the highest number of cases in a single year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. Elimination is when year-round transmission of an illness is interrupted, the CDC said. The unfortunate milestone was first reported by CNN and later acknowledged by the CDC.\n\"We are very concerned about the recent troubling rise of measles,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday. He noted that the majority of cases are in children who have not been vaccinated.\n\"Increased global measles activity poses a risk to U.S. elimination, particularly when unvaccinated travelers acquire measles abroad and return to communities with low vaccination rates,\" said a report published Monday by the CDC detailing the cases of the disease reported this year. According to the report, there have been 13 outbreaks of measles this year which account for 663 (94%) of the 704 cases. An outbreak is defined by the CDC as \"a chain of transmission of three or more cases linked in time and place and is determined by local and state health department investigations.\"\nSix of the outbreaks were in \"underimmunized close-knit religious or cultural communities.\" That includes the 474 cases reported by New York City and New York state, which account for 67% of all of this year's cases.\nThe New York outbreak began in October and is now the longest and largest outbreak in the Unites States since 2000. In all, more than 600 cases have been reported since October, mostly in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. It began when an unvaccinated child visited Israel, returned infected, then spread the disease to others, according to New York City health officials.\n\"The longer this lasts the greater chance it will get a foothold,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said. She added that these communities have been targeted with misinformation that has spread. Five cases of measles have been imported into the United States this year from Israel, which is just one of the countries where the 44 cases directly imported into this country in 2019 came from. The others are: Philippines (14 cases), Ukraine (8), Thailand (3), Vietnam (2), Germany (2), Algeria (1), France (1), India (1), Lithuania (1), Russia (1) and the UK (1), according to the CDC. An additional four travelers visited more than one country during the time when they would have been exposed to the virus. Of those travelers who brought measles to the United States after their trips, 88% were unvaccinated and all were old enough to be vaccinated, according to Messonnier.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the countries reporting the highest number of cases during the past 12 months were Ukraine (72,000), Madagascar (69,000) and India (60,000). \"Worldwide, 7 million measles cases are estimated to occur annually, and since 2016, measles incidence has increased in five of the six World Health Organization regions contributing to the ongoing risk for measles importation into the United States,\" the report said. The protection against the illness that results from a vaccination rate of more than 91% in children age 19 to 35 months is at risk because of unvaccinated and undervaccinated communities, the report warned. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR, measles, mumps and rubella, vaccine to protect against the illness. The first dose is to be given between 12 and 15 months old and a second dose between 4 and 6 years old, though it can be given as soon as 28 days after the first dose. Children who are between 6 and 11 months old are recommended to receive the vaccine before international travel and still receive the two other recommended doses as the first dose may not provide lasting protection. This is also now being recommended in communities where outbreaks are ongoing. Any individual who is unsure of their vaccination status is also recommended to be vaccinated before international travel.\nThe hallmark signs of measles is a rash of flat-red spots and a high fever. Although there is a sentiment that the illness is just a rash and fever that pass, complications can include encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, pneumonia and death. Of the 2019 cases in the United States, 66 patients (9%), have been hospitalized and 24 (3%) have had pneumonia, according to the report. No cases of encephalitis or deaths have been reported in the United States this year. The last measles death in the US occurred in 2015.\nAccording to the CDC one or two out of every 1,000 people infected in the United States will die from measles.\nBefore the measles vaccine was developed in 1963 an estimated 2.6 million people died globally from measles each year, according to WHO. In 2017, approximately 110,000 deaths resulted from measles, most of those were in children younger than 5.\nEven without complications, measles is costly. Messonnier said the average cost per case of measles in the United States is $32,000 which doesn't account for community and family cost, such as lost time at work.\nWalter Blum recovered from his case of measles. His mother hopes other parents will see the pictures of her sick baby and be motivated to vaccinate their children.",

Sporadic cases reported in the last three years were imported from abroad but were quickly detected, investigated and received a rapid response, WHO added.\n\"Sri Lanka's achievement comes at a time when globally measles cases are increasing,\" Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia, said in a statement.\n\"The country's success demonstrates its commitment, and the determination of its health workforce and parents to protect children against measles,\" she said. The highly contagious viral disease has made a comeback across the globe -- in high-income countries in the Americas and Europe, as well as in some low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency.\nThis year, the United States, where measles was declared eliminated in 2000, has experienced the highest number of measles cases since 1992. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday that the number of measles cases this year has reached 1,109 across 28 states. Europe has also seen a resurgence of cases, with Ukraine experiencing the worst outbreak in the region, totaling more than 25,000 cases recorded in the first two months of 2019.\nWHO attributed Sri Lanka's success to its efforts to ensure maximum coverage with two doses of measles and rubella vaccines being provided in the country's childhood immunization program. It said vaccination coverage was consistently high -- more than 95%.\nHowever, the global health body said that Sri Lanka would have to remain vigilant to keep its measles-free status. \"The risk of importations of measles virus from countries near and far will remain, specially from those that have significant population movement with Sri Lanka,\" Singh said.\nMeasles is one of the most contagious diseases and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes. If someone who is not immune to the virus breathes that air or touches an infected surface, they can become infected. To protect yourself against the measles, doctors recommend getting vaccinated. Other steps include washing your hands often or using hand sanitizer, avoiding touching your eyes and mouth, disinfecting surfaces and toys with standard household products, and refraining from coming into close contact with anyone who's sick.",
