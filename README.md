# MISINFORMATION
Data Container for Misinformation Data from LREC 2022


In this repository you're able to download close to 1 Million samples from our dataset. These are divided by disease, and are stored as JSON files. 

All data will be released after the end of the LREC 2022 conference in June. This helps us stay in accordance to citation guidlines, and sharing language resources with you directly.

As time passes you will be able to access starter code from here which will help with accessing the tweets directly. We are also continually working on the annotation pipeline which helps with creating more parts of our dataset annotated and ready to use. 

To access more data. You can do either of the following. 


1. Visit ankitaich.com and use the contact section to send an email directly to me asking for more data. 
2. From our paper you can directly email the first author to access more data. 

In your email specify your name, affiliation, and reason for more data access. We'll send over the data directly to you.
